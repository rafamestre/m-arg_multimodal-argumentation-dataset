f000001,0.000,2.000,"I want to talk about the minimum wage, gentlemen."
f000002,2.000,8.360,"Mr. Vice President, we are talking a lot about struggling small businesses and business owners these days."
f000003,8.360,11.680,"Do you think this is the right time to ask them to raise the minimum wage?"
f000004,11.680,13.840,"You of course support a $15 federal minimum wage."
f000005,13.840,18.840,"I do, because I think one of the things we’re going to have to do is we’re going to have to bail them out too."
f000006,18.840,22.600,"We should be bailing them out now, those small businesses."
f000007,22.600,24.680,"You got one in six of them going under."
f000008,24.680,27.240,"They’re not going to be able to make it back."
f000009,27.240,31.480,"They passed a package that allows us to be able… They call it PPP."
f000010,31.480,44.720,"Money is supposed to go to help them do everything from organize how they can deal with their businesses being open safely, schools, how they can make classrooms smaller, how they can hire more teachers, how they can put ventilation systems in."
f000011,44.720,46.600,"They need the help."
f000012,46.600,51.080,"The businesses, as well as the schools, need the help."
f000013,51.080,53.040,"These guys will not help them."
f000014,53.040,55.040,"It’s not giving them any of the money."
f000015,55.040,56.640,"We are going to move on to immigration, but I want to get-"
f000016,56.640,56.800,"Excuse me."
f000017,56.800,57.480,"One thing very quickly."
f000018,57.480,61.160,"He said we have to help our small businesses by raising the minimum wage."
f000019,61.160,62.200,"That’s not helping."
f000020,62.200,64.520,"I think it should be a state option."
f000021,64.520,66.920,"Alabama is different than New York."
f000022,66.920,69.120,"New York is different from Vermont."
f000023,69.120,70.440,"Every state is different."
f000024,70.440,71.440,"It should be a state option."
f000025,71.440,72.840,"You said very recently-"
f000026,72.840,73.920,"It’s very important."
f000027,73.920,75.480,"We have to help our small businesses."
f000028,75.480,76.080,"You said-"
f000029,76.080,79.000,"How are you helping your small businesses when you’re forcing wages?"
f000030,79.000,84.520,"What’s going to happen, and what’s been proven to happen, is when you do that, these small businesses fire many of their employees."
f000031,84.520,85.040,"You said very recently-"
f000032,85.040,86.280,"Not true, by the way."
f000033,86.280,89.240,"… you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour."
f000034,89.240,89.720,"Say it."
f000035,89.720,89.920,"Say it."
f000036,89.920,93.360,"You said recently you would consider raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour."
f000037,93.360,96.800,"What I really like, and I would consider it to an extent-"
f000038,96.800,98.160,"In a second administration?"
f000039,98.160,99.760,"But what I really like… In a second administration."
f000040,99.760,103.680,"But not to a level that’s going to put all these businesses out of business."
f000041,103.680,105.000,"It should be a state option."
f000042,105.000,105.600,"Look, I’ve lived-"
f000043,105.600,106.160,"Every-"
f000044,106.160,107.080,"… in different places."
f000045,107.080,107.960,"I know different places."
f000046,107.960,109.200,"They’re all different."
f000047,109.200,112.360,"Some places, $ 15 is not so bad."
f000048,112.360,114.680,"In other places, other states, $15 would be ruinings."
f000049,114.680,116.480,"Okay, President Trump, thank you."
f000050,116.480,118.480,"Quick response Vice President Biden."
f000051,118.480,122.320,"No one should work one job, be below poverty."
f000052,122.320,125.080,"People are making six, seven, eight bucks an hour."
f000053,125.080,130.920,"These first responders we all clap for as they come down the street because they’ve allowed us to make it."
f000054,130.920,131.880,"What’s happening?"
f000055,131.880,135.320,"They deserve a minimum wage of $15."
f000056,135.320,138.240,"Anything below that puts you below the poverty level."
f000057,138.240,143.040,"And there is no evidence that when you raise the minimum wage, businesses go out of business."
f000058,143.040,144.800,"That is simply not true."
f000059,144.800,146.200,"We’re going to talk about immigration."
f000060,146.200,146.240,"It’s an [crosstalk 00:32:35]-"
f000061,146.240,148.600,"We’re going to talk about immigration now, gentlemen."
f000062,148.600,151.160,"And we’re going to talk about families within this context."
f000063,151.160,157.280,"Mr. President, your administration separated children from their parents at the border, at least 4,000 kids."
f000064,157.280,164.040,"You’ve since reversed your zero tolerance policy, but the United States can’t locate the parents of more than 500 children."
f000065,164.040,166.640,"So how will these families ever be reunited?"
f000066,166.640,172.640,"Children are brought here by coyotes and lots of bad people, cartels…"
f000067,172.640,177.560,"[inaudible 00:33:00] and lots of bad people, cartels, and they’re brought here and they used to use them to get into our country."
f000068,177.560,180.640,"We now have as strong a border as we’ve ever had."
f000069,180.640,183.800,"We’re over 400 miles of brand new wall."
f000070,183.800,184.480,"You see the numbers."
f000071,184.480,187.880,"And we let people in, but they have to come in legally and they come in through [crosstalk 00:00:17]-"
f000072,187.880,190.800,"But how will you reunite these kids with their families, Mr. President?"
f000073,190.800,191.680,"But let me just tell you."
f000074,191.680,192.200,"Let me just tell you."
f000075,192.200,192.520,"They built cages."
f000076,192.520,201.480,"They used to say I built the cages, and then they had a picture in a certain newspaper, and it was the picture of these horrible cages and they said, “Look at these cages."
f000077,201.480,206.680,"President Trump built them.” And then it was determined they were built in 2014."
f000078,206.680,207.480,"That was him."
f000079,207.480,207.680,"They built cages."
f000080,207.680,209.360,"Do you have a plan to reunite the kids with their families?"
f000081,209.360,209.640,"Yes."
f000082,209.640,212.480,"We’re working on it very… We’re trying very hard."
f000083,212.480,214.600,"But a lot of these kids come out without the parents."
f000084,214.600,217.960,"They come over through cartels and through coyotes and through gangs."
f000085,217.960,220.080,"Vice President Biden, let me bring you into this conversation."
f000086,220.080,221.880,"Quick response, and then another question to you."
f000087,221.880,226.520,"These 500-plus kids came with parents."
f000088,226.520,231.160,"They separated them at the border to make it a disincentive to come to begin with."
f000089,231.160,233.440,"“Be real tough."
f000090,233.440,235.840,"We’re really strong.” And guess what?"
f000091,235.840,238.400,"They cannot… Coyotes didn’t bring them over."
f000092,238.400,240.160,"Their parents were with them."
f000093,240.160,242.960,"They got separated from their parents."
f000094,242.960,247.680,"And it makes us a laughingstock and violates every notion of who we are as a nation."
f000095,247.680,249.720,"Let me ask you a followup question."
f000096,249.720,250.080,"Kristen, they did it."
f000097,250.080,250.720,"We changed the policy."
f000098,250.720,251.120,"They did it."
f000099,251.120,251.560,"We changed."
f000100,251.560,252.560,"Your response to that?"
f000101,252.560,253.560,"We did not separate the [crosstalk 00:34:25]-"
f000102,253.560,254.320,"They built the cages."
f000103,254.320,256.480,"Who built the cages, Joe?"
f000104,256.480,258.000,"Let’s talk about what we’re talking about."
f000105,258.000,260.000,"Who built the cages, Joe?"
f000106,260.000,262.120,"Let’s talk about what we’re talking about."
f000107,262.120,263.440,"What happened?"
f000108,263.440,274.160,"Parents were ripped… Their kids were ripped from their arms and separated, and now they cannot find over 500 of the sets of those parents, and those kids are alone."
f000109,274.160,275.160,"Nowhere to go."
f000110,275.160,276.520,"Nowhere to go."
f000111,276.520,278.440,"It’s criminal."
f000112,278.440,279.120,"It’s criminal."
f000113,279.120,282.320,"Let me ask you about [crosstalk 00:34:50] in 10 seconds and then I need to ask [crosstalk 00:34:53]."
f000114,282.320,283.360,"Kristen, I will say this."
f000115,283.360,284.680,"They went down."
f000116,284.680,285.360,"We brought reporters, everything."
f000117,285.360,286.080,"They are so well taken care of."
f000118,286.080,288.480,"They’re in facilities that were so clean."
f000119,288.480,290.640,"But some of them haven’t been reunited with their families."
f000120,290.640,292.800,"They have gotten such good… But just ask one question."
f000121,292.800,293.120,"Who built the cages?"
f000122,293.120,294.120,"I’d love you to ask him that."
f000123,294.120,295.440,"Who built the cages, Joe?"
f000124,295.440,297.880,"Let me ask about your immigration policy, Mr. Vice President."
f000125,297.880,304.040,"The Obama Administration did fail to deliver immigration reform, which had been a key promise during the administration."
f000126,304.040,309.920,"It also presided over record deportations, as well as, family detentions at the border before changing course."
f000127,309.920,312.760,"So why should voters trust you with an immigration overhaul now?"
f000128,312.760,314.800,"Because we made a mistake made."
f000129,314.800,316.600,"It took too long to get it right."
f000130,316.600,318.600,"Took too long to get it right."
f000131,318.600,321.640,"I’ll be President of the United States, not Vice President of the United States."
f000132,321.640,323.960,"And the fact is I’ve made it very clear."
f000133,323.960,332.840,"Within a 100 days, I’m going to send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11 million undocumented people."
f000134,332.840,343.200,"And all of those so-called dreamers, those DACA kids, they’re going to be immediately certified again to be able to stay in this country and put on a path to citizenship."
f000135,343.200,350.520,"The idea that they are being sent home by this guy and they want to do that is they’ve gone to they’ve never seen before."
f000136,350.520,351.600,"I can imagine."
f000137,351.600,352.840,"You’re five years old."
f000138,352.840,357.480,"Your parents are taking across the Rio Grande River and it’s illegal."
f000139,357.480,360.000,"And you say, “Oh, no, Mom."
f000140,360.000,360.480,"Leave me here."
f000141,360.480,362.080,"I’m not going to go with you.” They been here."
f000142,362.080,363.880,"Many of them are model citizens."
f000143,363.880,369.200,"Over 20,000 of them are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis."
f000144,369.200,370.960,"We owe them."
f000145,370.960,372.120,"We owe them."
f000146,372.120,374.880,"President Trump, your reaction."
f000147,374.880,377.760,"Kristen, he had eight years to do what he said he was going to do."
f000148,377.760,379.560,"And I’ve changed."
f000149,379.560,383.760,"Without having a specific, we got rid of catch and release."
f000150,383.760,388.240,"We got rid of a lot of horrible things that they put in and that they lived with."
f000151,388.240,390.800,"But he had eight years he was Vice President."
f000152,390.800,396.400,"He did nothing except build cages to keep children in."
f000153,396.400,398.360,"Vice President Biden, your response."
f000154,398.360,400.720,"The catch and release, you know what he’s talking about there?"
f000155,400.720,408.960,"If in fact you had a family came across and they were arrested, they in fact were given a date to show up for their hearing."
f000156,408.960,410.440,"They were released."
f000157,410.440,411.080,"And guess what?"
f000158,411.080,413.000,"They showed up for a hearing."
f000159,413.000,420.080,"And this is the first President in the history of the United States of America that anybody seeking asylum has to do it in another country."
f000160,420.080,422.200,"That’s never happened before in America."
f000161,422.200,424.080,"That’s never happened before in America."
f000162,424.080,436.120,"You come to the United States and you make your case that, “I seek asylum based on the following premise, why I deserve it under American law.” They’re sitting in squalor on the other side of the river."
f000163,436.120,437.600,"President Trump, your response."
f000164,437.600,438.360,"30 seconds."
f000165,438.360,439.320,"And then we’ll move on."
f000166,439.320,439.760,"So important."
f000167,439.760,443.960,"It just shows that he has no understanding of immigration, of the laws."
f000168,443.960,445.920,"Catch and release is a disaster."
f000169,445.920,447.880,"A murderer would come in."
f000170,447.880,449.760,"A rapist would come in."
f000171,449.760,451.960,"A very bad person would come in."
f000172,451.960,453.920,"We would take their name."
f000173,453.920,456.880,"We have to release them into our country."
f000174,456.880,458.880,"And then you say they come back."
f000175,458.880,462.240,"Less than 1% of the people come back."
f000176,462.240,466.240,"We have to send ICE out and Border Patrol out to find them."
f000177,466.240,469.800,"We would say, “Come back in two years, three years."
f000178,469.800,471.040,"We’re going to give you a court case."
f000179,471.040,471.960,"You did Perry Mason."
f000180,471.960,476.720,"We’re going to give you a court case.” When you say they come back, they don’t come back, Joe."
f000181,476.720,478.360,"They never come back."
f000182,478.360,486.560,"Only the really… I hate to say this, but those with the lowest IQ, they might come back, but there are very, very few."
f000183,486.560,487.520,"Okay, President Trump."
f000184,487.520,490.600,"Let’s give Vice President Biden a chance to respond, and then we’re going to move on to the next section."
f000185,490.600,490.680,"You don’t know the law, Joe."
f000186,490.680,492.560,"Vice President Biden, your response."
f000187,492.560,494.440,"Know the law, what he’s telling you is simply not true."
f000188,494.440,494.720,"Check it out."
f000189,494.720,495.920,"Well, check it out."
f000190,495.920,496.280,"They don’t come back."
f000191,496.280,496.760,"Check it out."
f000192,496.760,497.760,"All right."
f000193,497.760,498.200,"Let’s move on to the next section."
f000194,498.200,500.200,"But we don’t have to worry about it, because they terminated it."
f000195,500.200,500.920,"So we don’t have to worry about it anymore, Joe."
f000196,500.920,501.360,"Let’s move on to the next section."
f000197,501.360,502.040,"That’s right."
f000198,502.040,506.400,"And you 525 kids not knowing where in God’s name they’re going to be and lost their parents."
f000199,506.400,506.800,"Go ahead."
f000200,506.800,507.280,"All right."
f000201,507.280,511.240,"Let’s talk about our next section, which is race in America."
f000202,511.240,516.600,"And I want to talk about the way Black and Brown Americans experience race in this country."
f000203,516.600,520.280,"Part of that experience is something called the talk."
f000204,520.280,534.120,"It happens regardless of class and income, parents who feel they have no choice, but to prepare their children for the chance that they could be targeted, including by the police, for no reason other than the color of their skin."
f000205,534.120,539.560,"Mr. Vice President, in the next two minutes, I want you to speak directly to these families."
f000206,539.560,542.960,"Do you understand why these parents fear for their children?"
f000207,542.960,543.640,"I do."
f000208,543.640,544.560,"I do."
f000209,544.560,551.320,"My daughter is a social worker and she’s written a lot about this."
f000210,551.320,556.280,"She has her graduate degree from the University of Pennsylvania in social work."
f000211,556.280,566.200,"And one of the reasons why I ended up working on the East Side of Wilmington, Delaware, which is 90% African-American, was to learn more about what was going on."
f000212,566.200,572.680,"I never had to tell my daughter if she’s pulled over, make sure she puts… For a traffic stop."
f000213,572.680,587.480,"“Put both hands on top of the wheel and don’t reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you.” But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, “When you’re walking down the street, don’t have a hoodie on when you go across the street."
f000214,587.480,592.480,"Making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over just, yes, sir, no, sir."
f000215,592.480,593.960,"Hands on top of the wheel."
f000216,593.960,604.840,"Because you are in fact, the victim, whether you’re a person making 300,000 … child of a $300,000 a year person or someone who’s on food stamps."
f000217,604.840,609.480,"The fact of the matter is, there is institutional racism in America."
f000218,609.480,615.680,"And we have always said, we’ve never lived up to it, that we hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women are created equal."
f000219,615.680,619.320,"Well, guess what, we have never, ever lived up to it."
f000220,619.320,625.040,"But we’ve always constantly been moving the needle further and further to inclusion, not exclusion."
f000221,625.040,628.600,"This is the first president to come along and says, that’s the end of that."
f000222,628.600,630.080,"We’re not going to do that anymore."
f000223,630.080,643.120,"We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better healthcare, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses, all the things we can do."
f000224,643.120,648.680,"And I’ve laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things just to give people a shot."
f000225,648.680,654.320,"It’s about accumulating the ability to have wealth as well as it is to be free from violence."
f000226,654.320,658.840,"President Trump, same question to you, and let me remind you of the question."
f000227,658.840,664.320,"I would like you to speak directly to these families, do you understand why these parents fear for their children?"
f000228,664.320,665.200,"Yes, I do."
f000229,665.200,679.000,"And again, he’s been in government 47 years, he never did a thing, except in 1994, when he did such harm to the black community, and they were called … and he called them superpredators."
f000230,679.000,681.880,"And he said that, he said it, superpredators."
f000231,681.880,683.920,"And they never lived that down."
f000232,683.920,688.240,"1994, your crime bill, the superpredators."
f000233,688.240,692.480,"Nobody has done more for the black community than Donald Trump."
f000234,692.480,702.800,"And if you look, with the exception of Abraham Lincoln, possible exception, but the exception of Abraham Lincoln, nobody has done what I’ve done."
f000235,702.800,706.960,"Criminal justice reform, Obama and Joe didn’t do it."
f000236,706.960,711.360,"I don’t even think they tried because they had no chance at doing it."
f000237,711.360,713.200,"They might’ve wanted to do it."
f000238,713.200,718.280,"But if you had to see the arms I had to twist to get that done, it was not a pretty picture."
f000239,718.280,723.000,"And everybody knows it, including some very liberal people that cried in my office."
f000240,723.000,724.600,"They cried in the Oval Office."
f000241,724.600,735.760,"Two weeks later, they’re out saying, “Gee, we have to defeat him.” Criminal justice reform, prison reform, Opportunity Zones with Tim Scott, a great Senator from South Carolina."
f000242,735.760,738.920,"He came in with this incredible idea for Opportunity Zones."
f000243,738.920,741.080,"It’s one of the most successful programs."
f000244,741.080,742.400,"People don’t talk about it."
f000245,742.400,748.320,"Tremendous investment is being made, biggest beneficiary, the black and Hispanic communities."
f000246,748.320,756.400,"And then Historically Black Colleges and Universities, after three years of coming to the office, I love some of those guys, they were great."
f000247,756.400,766.120,"They came into the office and I said, “What are you doing?” After three years, I said, “Why do you keep coming back?” Because we have no funding.” I said, “You don’t have to come back every year.” “We have to come back.”"
f000248,766.120,771.080,"Because President Obama would never give them long-term funding and I did."
f000249,771.080,784.960,"10 year long-term funding and I gave them more money than they asked for because I said, “I think you need more.” And I said, “The only bad part about this is I may never see you again.” Because I got very friendly with them and they like me and I like them."
f000250,784.960,788.680,"But I saved Historically Black Colleges and Universities."
f000251,788.680,792.880,"Okay, and we’re going to talk about both of your records, but your response to that Vice President."
f000252,792.880,796.840,"My response to that is I never ever said what he accused me of saying."
f000253,796.840,809.000,"The fact of the matter is in 2000 though, after the crime bill had been in the law for awhile, this is a guy who said, “The problem with the crime bill, there’s not enough people in jail."
f000254,809.000,821.520,"There’s not enough people in jail.” And go on my website, get the quote, the date when he said it, “not enough people.” He talked about marauding gangs, young gangs, and the people who are going to maraud our cities."
f000255,821.520,828.480,"This is a guy who in the Central Park Five, five innocent black kids, he continued to push for making sure that they got the death penalty."
f000256,828.480,833.960,"None of them were guilty of the crimes they were suggested."
f000257,833.960,840.960,"Look and granted, he did in fact, let 20 people … he commuted 20 people’s sentences."
f000258,840.960,844.840,"We commuted over 1,000 people’s sentences, over 1,000."
f000259,844.840,850.200,"The very law he’s talking about is a law that in fact, initiated by Barack Obama."
f000260,850.200,859.160,"And secondly, we’re in a situation here where the federal prison system was reduced by 38,000 people under our administration."
f000261,859.160,865.600,"And one of those things we should be doing, there should be no, no minimum mandatories in the law."
f000262,865.600,873.440,"That’s why I’m offering $20 billion to states to change their state laws to eliminate minimum mandatories and set up drug courts."
f000263,873.440,876.440,"No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem."
f000264,876.440,879.520,"They should be going to rehabilitation, not to jail."
f000265,879.520,882.840,"We should fundamentally change the system and that’s what I’m going to do."
f000266,882.840,885.320,"But why didn’t he do it four years ago?"
f000267,885.320,887.840,"Why didn’t you do that four years ago?"
f000268,887.840,888.320,"Even less than that."
f000269,888.320,890.720,"Why didn’t you when you vice president?"
f000270,890.720,898.280,"You keep talking about all these things you’re going to do, and you’re going to do this, but you were there just a short time ago and you guys did nothing."
f000271,898.280,898.720,"We did-"
f000272,898.720,901.000,"You know Joe, I ran because of you."
f000273,901.000,904.640,"I ran because of Barack Obama, because you did a poor job."
f000274,904.640,907.040,"If I thought you did a good job, I would’ve never run."
f000275,907.040,908.240,"I would’ve never run."
f000276,908.240,909.720,"I ran because of you."
f000277,909.720,913.440,"I’m looking at you now, you’re a politician, I ran because of you."
f000278,913.440,915.160,"All right, Vice President Biden, your response to that."
f000279,915.160,917.560,"And then I do have some questions for both of you."
f000280,917.560,923.320,"Well, I’ll tell you what I hope he does look at me because what’s happening here is, you know who I am."
f000281,923.320,930.320,"You know who he is, you know his character, you know my character, you know our reputations for honor and telling the truth."
f000282,930.320,933.000,"I am anxious to have this race."
f000283,933.000,935.360,"I’m anxious to see this take place."
f000284,935.360,938.960,"I am … The character of the country is on the ballot."
f000285,938.960,941.640,"Our character’s on the ballot, look at us closely."
f000286,941.640,942.560,"Let me ask some follow up-"
f000287,942.560,943.200,"Excuse me-"
f000288,943.200,944.760,"Please respond and then we’re going to have follow up questions."
f000289,944.760,948.880,"If this stuff is true about Russia, Ukraine, China, other countries, Iraq."
f000290,948.880,952.280,"If this is true, then he’s a corrupt politician."
f000291,952.280,955.920,"So don’t give me the stuff about how you’re this innocent baby."
f000292,955.920,957.520,"Joe, that calling you a corrupt politician-"
f000293,957.520,958.800,"Nobody’s calling me-"
f000294,958.800,960.760,"They’re calling it the laptop from hell."
f000295,960.760,962.360,"President Trump, I want to stay on the issue of race."
f000296,962.360,963.120,"We’re talking about the issue-"
f000297,963.120,964.040,"Excuse me, [crosstalk 00:06:13] the laptop from hell."
f000298,964.040,964.080,"Nobody."
f000299,964.080,966.400,"President Trump, we’re talking about race right now."
f000300,966.400,968.520,"And I do want to stay on the issue of race."
f000301,968.520,970.080,"President Trump you-"
f000302,970.080,970.880,"I have to respond to that."
f000303,970.880,972.080,"Because look-"
f000304,972.080,973.200,"Please, very quickly."
f000305,973.200,979.120,"There are 50 former national intelligence folks who said that what he’s accusing me of is a Russian plant."
f000306,979.120,988.640,"They have said that this has all the … five former heads of the CIA, both parties, say what he’s saying is a bunch of garbage."
f000307,988.640,993.320,"Nobody believes it except him and his good friend, Rudy Giuliani."
f000308,993.320,997.200,"You mean the laptop is now another Russia, Russia, Russia hoax?"
f000309,997.200,997.640,"You got to be kidding me-"
f000310,997.640,1000.280,"That’s exactly what was told."
f000311,1000.280,1001.840,"This is where he’s going."
f000312,1001.840,1004.920,"The laptop is Russia, Russia, Russia?"
f000313,1004.920,1006.640,"Gentlemen, I want to stay on the issue of race."
f000314,1006.640,1008.640,"You have to be kidding, here we go again with the Russia."
f000315,1008.640,1009.240,"Boy, oh, boy."
f000316,1009.240,1010.040,"We’re going to continue on the issue of race."
f000317,1010.040,1010.800,"Can’t believe that one."
f000318,1010.800,1015.520,"Mr. President you’ve described the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of hate."
f000319,1015.520,1019.680,"You’ve shared a video of a man chanting white power to millions of your supporters."
f000320,1019.680,1025.080,"You’ve said that black professional athletes exercising their First Amendment rights should be fired."
f000321,1025.080,1031.800,"What do you say to Americans who say that kind of language from a president is contributing to a climate of hate and racial strife?"
f000322,1031.800,1041.240,"Well, you have to understand the first time I ever heard of Black Lives Matter, they were chanting, “Pigs in a blanket,” talking about police, pigs, pigs, talking about our police."
f000323,1041.240,1047.760,"“Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon.” I said, “That’s a horrible thing.” And they were marching down the street."
f000324,1047.760,1052.720,"And that was my first glimpse of Black Lives Matter, I thought it was a terrible thing."
f000325,1052.720,1060.440,"As far as my relationships with all people, I think I have great relationships with all people."
f000326,1060.440,1064.120,"I am the least racist person in this room."
f000327,1064.120,1066.960,"What do you say to Americans who are concerned by that rhetoric [crosstalk 00:00:07:58]?"
f000328,1066.960,1067.240,"I don’t know."
f000329,1067.240,1069.040,"I mean, I don’t know what to say."
f000330,1069.040,1072.320,"I got criminal justice reform done and prison reform and Opportunity Zones-"
f000331,1072.320,1080.800,"… got criminal justice reform done, and prison reform, and Opportunity Zones, I took care of Black colleges and universities, I don’t know what to say, they can say anything, I mean, they can say anything."
f000332,1080.800,1094.920,"It’s a very… Makes me sad, because I am the least racist person, I can’t even see the audience because it’s so dark, but I don’t care who’s in the audience, I’m the least racist person in this room."
f000333,1094.920,1095.760,"Okay."
f000334,1095.760,1099.440,"Vice President Biden, let me ask you very quickly and then I have a follow-up question for you."
f000335,1099.440,1109.200,"Abraham Lincoln here is one of the most racist presidents we’ve had in modern history, he pours fuel on every single racist fire, every single one."
f000336,1109.200,1122.080,"Started off his campaign coming down the escalator saying he’s getting rid of those Mexican rapists, he’s ban Muslims because they’re Muslims, he has moved around and made everything worse across the board."
f000337,1122.080,1132.840,"He says to… About the Proud Boys, last time we were on stage here he said, “I tell them to stand down and stand ready.” Come on, this guy has a dog whistle about as big as a foghorn."
f000338,1132.840,1136.560,"President Trump, I’m going to give you 10 seconds to respond and then I have a follow-up question."
f000339,1136.560,1139.240,"No, he made a reference to Abraham Lincoln, where did that come in?"
f000340,1139.240,1139.600,"I mean-"
f000341,1139.600,1141.480,"You said you’re Abraham Lincoln."
f000342,1141.480,1142.840,"… where did that….. No."
f000343,1142.840,1142.840,"You said-"
f000344,1142.840,1148.880,"I said, “Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I’ve done for the Black community.”"
f000345,1148.880,1149.560,"And I’m saying-"
f000346,1149.560,1161.520,"I didn’t say, “I’m Abraham Lincoln,” I said, “Not since Abraham Lincoln has anybody done what I’ve done for the Black community.” Now, you have done nothing other than the Crime Bill, which put-"
f000347,1161.520,1162.320,"Oh, God."
f000348,1162.320,1164.880,"Tens of thousands of Black men, mostly, in jail."
f000349,1164.880,1165.040,"Not true."
f000350,1165.040,1168.640,"All right, let me ask Vice President Biden a question."
f000351,1168.640,1169.520,"And you know what?"
f000352,1169.520,1178.160,"They remember it because if you look at what’s happening with the voting right now, they remember that you treated them very, very badly, just take a look at what’s happening out there."
f000353,1178.160,1197.920,"Let me ask Vice President Biden about… Vice President Biden, let me give you a chance to respond within this context, crime bills that you supported in the ’80s and ’90s contributed to the incarceration of tens of thousands of young Black men who had small amounts of drugs in their possession, they are sons, they are brothers, they are fathers, they are uncles, whose families are still to this day, some of them suffering the consequences."
f000354,1197.920,1200.400,"So, speak to those families, why should they vote for you?"
f000355,1200.400,1211.840,"One of the things is that in the ’80s we passed 100 percent, all 100 senators voted for a bill on drugs and how to deal with drugs, it was a mistake."
f000356,1211.840,1215.640,"I’ve been trying to change since then particularly the portion on cocaine."
f000357,1215.640,1229.040,"That’s why I’ve been arguing that in fact we should not send anyone to jail for a pure drug offense, they should be going into treatment across the board, that’s what we should be spending money."
f000358,1229.040,1232.840,"And that’s why I set up drug courts which were never funded by our Republican friends."
f000359,1232.840,1240.320,"They should not be going to jail for a drug or an alcohol problem, they should be going into treatment."
f000360,1240.320,1253.480,"That’s what we’ve been trying to do, that’s what I’m going to get done because I think the American people have now seen that in fact it was a mistake to pass those laws relating to drugs, but they were not in the Crime Bill."
f000361,1253.480,1253.480,"[crosstalk 00:11:04]."
f000362,1253.480,1255.240,"But, why didn’t he get it done?"
f000363,1255.240,1259.600,"See, it’s all talk, no action with these politicians, why didn’t he get it?"
f000364,1259.600,1268.800,"“That’s what I’m going to do when I become president.” You were vice president along with Obama as your president, your leader, for eight years, why didn’t you get it done?"
f000365,1268.800,1272.360,"You had eight years to get it done, now you’re saying you’re going to get it done because you’re all talking and no action, Joe."
f000366,1272.360,1272.800,"Your response."
f000367,1272.800,1274.240,"We got a lot of it done."
f000368,1274.240,1275.760,"We released 38,000-"
f000369,1275.760,1277.080,"You didn’t get anything done."
f000370,1277.080,1279.400,"We got 38,000 prisoners [ crosstalk 00:11:30]-"
f000371,1279.400,1280.640,"You got nothing done."
f000372,1280.640,1287.720,"38,000 prisoners were released from federal prison, we have… There were over a thousand people who were given clemency."
f000373,1287.720,1287.720,"[inaudible 00:03:38]."
f000374,1287.720,1296.600,"In fact, were the ones that put in the legislation saying we could look at pattern and practice of police departments and what they were doing, how they’re conducting themselves."
f000375,1296.600,1306.040,"I could go on, but we began the process, we lost an election, that’s why I’m running to win back that election and change his terrible policy."
f000376,1306.040,1306.480,"I just have-"
f000377,1306.480,1309.080,"Your response and then we’re going to move on to climate change."
f000378,1309.080,1313.720,"… one question, why didn’t you do it in the eight years, a short time ago?"
f000379,1313.720,1314.960,"Why didn’t you do it?"
f000380,1314.960,1326.840,"You just said, “I’m going to do that, I’m going to do this.” You put tens of thousands of mostly Black young men in prison, now you’re saying you’re going to get… You’re going to undo that, why didn’t you get it done?"
f000381,1326.840,1328.200,"You had eight years with Obama."
f000382,1328.200,1329.440,"You know why, Joe?"
f000383,1329.440,1331.520,"Because you’re all talk and no action."
f000384,1331.520,1331.520,"[crosstalk 00:00:12:23]."
f000385,1331.520,1334.280,"All right, Vice President Biden, and then we’re going to move on to the next section."
f000386,1334.280,1340.640,"We had a Republican Congress, that’s the answer."
f000387,1340.640,1341.320,"Okay."
f000388,1341.320,1344.200,"Well, you got to talk them into it, Joe, sometimes you got to talk them into it."
f000389,1344.200,1347.080,"We’re going to move on to our next section which is climate change."
f000390,1347.080,1350.280,"… like I did with criminal justice reform, I had to talk Democrats into it."
f000391,1350.280,1351.240,"You did what we already had done."
f000392,1351.240,1355.120,"Gentlemen, we’re running out of time so we got to get onto climate change, please."
f000393,1355.120,1358.400,"You both have very different visions on climate change."
f000394,1358.400,1369.120,"President Trump, you say that environmental regulations have hurt jobs in the energy sector, Vice President Biden, you have said you see addressing climate change as an opportunity to create new jobs."
f000395,1369.120,1374.480,"For each of you, how would you both combat climate change and support job growth at the same time?"
f000396,1374.480,1378.360,"Starting with you, President Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted."
f000397,1378.360,1389.120,"So, we have the trillion trees program, we have so many different programs, I do love the environment, but what I want is that cleanest crystal clear water, the cleanest air."
f000398,1389.120,1402.960,"We have the best lowest number in carbon emissions, which is a big standard that I noticed Obama goes with all the time, not Joe, I haven’t heard Joe use the term because I’m not sure he knows what it represents or means, but I have heard Obama use it."
f000399,1402.960,1414.880,"And we have the best carbon emission numbers that we’ve had in 35 years under this administration, we are working so well with industry, but here’s what we can’t do."
f000400,1414.880,1424.520,"Look at China, how filthy it is, look at Russia, look at India, it’s filthy, the air is filthy."
f000401,1424.520,1432.200,"The [Paris Accord 00:00:13:55], I took us out because we were going to have to spend trillions of dollars and we were treated very unfairly."
f000402,1432.200,1436.480,"When they put us in there, they did us a great disservice, they were going to take away our businesses."
f000403,1436.480,1447.360,"I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs, thousands and thousands of companies because of the Paris Accord, it was so unfair."
f000404,1447.360,1458.240,"China doesn’t kick in until 2030, Russia goes back to a low standard, and we kicked in right away, it would have been… It would have destroyed our businesses."
f000405,1458.240,1459.760,"So, you ready?"
f000406,1459.760,1469.440,"We have done an incredible job environmentally, we have the cleanest air, the cleanest water, and the best carbon emission standards that we’ve seen in many, many years."
f000407,1469.440,1471.240,"Vice President Biden-"
f000408,1471.240,1472.680,"And we haven’t destroyed our industries."
f000409,1472.680,1475.840,"Vice President Biden, two minutes to you uninterrupted."
f000410,1475.840,1482.000,"Climate change, global warming is an existential threat to humanity."
f000411,1482.000,1486.000,"We have a moral obligation to deal with it."
f000412,1486.000,1495.600,"And we’re told by all the leading scientists in the world we don’t have much time, we’re going to pass the point of no return within the next 8 to 10 years."
f000413,1495.600,1509.880,"Four more years of this man eliminating all the regulations that were put in by us to clean up the climate, to clean up… To limit the emissions, will put us in a position where we’re going to be in real trouble."
f000414,1509.880,1512.040,"Here’s where we have a great opportunity."
f000415,1512.040,1520.800,"I was able to get both all the environmental organizations as well as the labor, the people worried about jobs, to support my climate plan."
f000416,1520.800,1537.040,"Because what it does, it will create millions of new good paying jobs, we’re going to invest in, for example, 500,000… Excuse me, 50,000 charging stations on our highways so that we can own the electric car market of the future."
f000417,1537.040,1539.360,"In the meantime, China is doing that."
f000418,1539.360,1550.200,"We’re going to be in a position where we’re going to see to it that we’re going to take 4 million existing buildings and 2 million existing homes and retrofit them so they don’t leak as much energy, saving hundreds of millions of barrels of…"
f000419,1550.200,1557.520,"So they don’t leak as much energy saving hundreds of millions of barrels of oil in the process and creating significant number of jobs."
f000420,1557.520,1565.480,"By the way, the whole idea of what this is all going to do, it’s going to create millions of jobs and it’s going to clean the environment."
f000421,1565.480,1568.400,"Our health and our jobs are at stake."
f000422,1568.400,1581.560,"That’s what’s happening and what right now, by the way, Wall Street firms indicated that my plan, my plan will in fact, create 18.6 million jobs, 7 million more than his."
f000423,1581.560,1588.120,"This is from Wall Street and I’ll create $1 trillion more in economic growth than his proposal does."
f000424,1588.120,1590.240,"Not on climate, just on economy."
f000425,1590.240,1591.680,"President Trump, your response."
f000426,1591.680,1601.080,"They came out and said very strongly $6,500 will be taken away from families under his plan, that his plan is an economic disaster."
f000427,1601.080,1605.440,"If you look at what he wants to do, if you look at his plan, his-"
f000428,1605.440,1605.440,"[crosstalk 00:16:56]."
f000429,1605.440,1607.560,"… his environmental plan, do you know developed it?"
f000430,1607.560,1611.760,"AOC plus three, they know nothing about the climate."
f000431,1611.760,1619.640,"I mean, she’s got a good line of stuff, but she knows nothing about the climate and they’re all hopping through hoops for AOC plus three."
f000432,1619.640,1623.920,"Look, their real plan cost a hundred trillion dollars."
f000433,1623.920,1631.560,"If we had the best year in the history of our country for a hundred years, we would not even come close to a number like that."
f000434,1631.560,1637.320,"When he says buildings, they want to take buildings down because they want to make bigger windows into smaller windows."
f000435,1637.320,1640.960,"As far as they’re concerned, if you had no window, it would be a lovely thing."
f000436,1640.960,1647.640,"This is the craziest plan that anybody has ever seen and this wasn’t done by smart people."
f000437,1647.640,1650.000,"This wasn’t done by anybody."
f000438,1650.000,1652.760,"Frankly, I don’t even know how it can be good politically."
f000439,1652.760,1655.760,"They want to spend a hundred trillion dollars."
f000440,1655.760,1656.440,"That’s their real number."
f000441,1656.440,1657.640,"He’s trying to say it was six."
f000442,1657.640,1659.920,"It’s a hundred trillion dollars."
f000443,1659.920,1664.840,"They want to knock down buildings and build new buildings with little, tiny, small windows and many other things-"
f000444,1664.840,1665.040,"Okay."
f000445,1665.040,1665.600,"And many other things."
f000446,1665.600,1666.680,"And many other things."
f000447,1666.680,1669.120,"Okay, let me have the vice-president respond."
f000448,1669.120,1669.840,"It is crazy."
f000449,1669.840,1673.440,"We’re running out of time and we have a lot more questions to get back to."
f000450,1673.440,1674.160,"You’ll destroy our country."
f000451,1674.160,1675.560,"So let’s hear from the vice president."
f000452,1675.560,1677.000,"I have a number of more question.."
f000453,1677.000,1678.800,"I don’t know where he comes from."
f000454,1678.800,1681.600,"I don’t know where he comes up with these numbers."
f000455,1681.600,1682.040,"Queens."
f000456,1682.040,1684.160,"A hundred trillion dollars, give me a break."
f000457,1684.160,1693.480,"This plan has been endorsed by every major, every major environmental group and every labor group, labor, because they know the future lies."
f000458,1693.480,1698.560,"The future lies in us being able to breathe and they know they’re good jobs and getting us there."
f000459,1698.560,1708.680,"By the way, the fastest growing industry in America is the electric, excuse me, solar energy and wind."
f000460,1708.680,1711.240,"He thinks wind causes cancer, windmills."
f000461,1711.240,1717.920,"It’s the fastest growing jobs and they pay good prevailing wages, 45, 50 bucks an hour."
f000462,1717.920,1722.640,"We can grow and we can be cleaner if we go the route I’m proposing."
f000463,1722.640,1723.600,"President Trump-"
f000464,1723.600,1724.800,"Excuse me."
f000465,1724.800,1727.440,"Please respond and then I have his follow up."
f000466,1727.440,1728.840,"We are energy independent for first time."
f000467,1728.840,1733.960,"We don’t need all of these countries that we had to fight war over because we needed their energy."
f000468,1733.960,1735.480,"We are energy independent."
f000469,1735.480,1737.600,"I know more about wind than you do."
f000470,1737.600,1739.480,"It’s extremely expensive."
f000471,1739.480,1741.400,"Kills all the birds."
f000472,1741.400,1742.880,"It’s very intermittent."
f000473,1742.880,1758.360,"It’s got a lot of problems and they happen to make the windmills in both Germany and China and the fumes coming up, if you’re a believer in carbon emission, the fumes coming up to make these massive windmills is more than anything that we’re talking about with natural gas, which is very clear."
f000474,1758.360,1759.040,"One other thing, solar-"
f000475,1759.040,1760.360,"Find me a scientist who says that."
f000476,1760.360,1763.240,"I love solar, but solar doesn’t quite have it yet."
f000477,1763.240,1770.920,"It’s not powerful yet to really run our big, beautiful factories that we need to compete with the world."
f000478,1770.920,1771.800,"False."
f000479,1771.800,1774.720,"It’s all a pipe dream, but you know what we’ll do?"
f000480,1774.720,1780.360,"We’re going to have the greatest economy in the world, but if you want to kill the economy, get rid of your oil industry you want."
f000481,1780.360,1781.280,"And what about fracking?"
f000482,1781.280,1781.680,"Let me-"
f000483,1781.680,1783.440,"Now we have to ask him about fracking."
f000484,1783.440,1787.240,"Let me allow the Vice President Biden to respond."
f000485,1787.240,1789.920,"I never said I oppose fracking."
f000486,1789.920,1791.920,"You said it on tape."
f000487,1791.920,1794.120,"Show the tape, put it on your website."
f000488,1794.120,1794.640,"I’ll put it on."
f000489,1794.640,1795.640,"Put it on the website."
f000490,1795.640,1798.280,"The fact of the matter is he’s flat lying."
f000491,1798.280,1800.080,"Would you rule out about banning fracking?"
f000492,1800.080,1813.280,"I do rule out banning fracking because the answer we need, we need other industries to transition, to get to ultimately a complete zero emissions by 2025."
f000493,1813.280,1821.760,"What I will do with fracking over time is make sure that we can capture the emissions from the fracking, capture the emissions from gas."
f000494,1821.760,1827.520,"We can do that and we can do that by investing money in doing it, but it’s a transition to that."
f000495,1827.520,1829.600,"I have one more question in this pile then-"
f000496,1829.600,1829.800,"Excuse me."
f000497,1829.800,1831.480,"He was against fracking."
f000498,1831.480,1832.400,"He said it."
f000499,1832.400,1834.000,"I will show that to you tomorrow."
f000500,1834.000,1834.200,"Good."
f000501,1834.200,1836.160,"I am against fracking."
f000502,1836.160,1838.640,"Until he got the nomination, he went to Pennsylvania."
f000503,1838.640,1843.800,"Then he said, “But you know what Pennsylvania?” He’ll be against it very soon because his party is totally against it."
f000504,1843.800,1845.200,"Fracking on federal land."
f000505,1845.200,1848.440,"I said, no fracking and/or oil on federal land."
f000506,1848.440,1853.560,"Let me ask this final question in this section and then I want to move on to our final section."
f000507,1853.560,1859.040,"President Trump, people of color are much more likely to live near oil refineries and chemical plants."
f000508,1859.040,1863.600,"In Texas, there are families who worry the plants near them are making them sick."
f000509,1863.600,1867.440,"Your administration has rolled back regulations on these kinds of facilities."
f000510,1867.440,1870.560,"Why should these families give you another four years in office?"
f000511,1870.560,1877.240,"The families that we’re talking about are employed heavily and they are making a lot of money, more money than they’ve ever made."
f000512,1877.240,1896.640,"If you look at the kind of numbers that we’ve produced for Hispanic, for Black, for Asian, it’s nine times greater the percentage gain than it was under in three years than it was under eight years of the two of them to put it nicely, nine times more."
f000513,1896.640,1905.920,"Now somebody lives, I have not heard the numbers or the statistics that you’re saying, but they’re making a tremendous amount of money."
f000514,1905.920,1912.600,"Economically, we saved it and I saved it again a number of months ago, when oil was crashing because of the pandemic."
f000515,1912.600,1913.480,"We saved it."
f000516,1913.480,1915.760,"Say what you want to bet relationship."
f000517,1915.760,1920.960,"We got Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Russia to cut back, way back."
f000518,1920.960,1926.520,"We saved our oil industry and now it’s very vibrant again and everybody has very inexpensive gasoline."
f000519,1926.520,1926.520,"Remember that."
f000520,1926.520,1930.640,"Vice President Biden, your response and then we’re going to have a final question for both of you."
f000521,1930.640,1934.080,"My response is that those people live on what they call fence lines."
f000522,1934.080,1935.760,"He doesn’t understand this."
f000523,1935.760,1942.120,"They live near chemical plants that in fact, pollute, chemical plants and oil plants and refineries that pollute."
f000524,1942.120,1952.360,"I used to live near that when I was growing up in Claymont, Delaware and there are more oil refineries in Marcus Hook and the Delaware River than there is any place, including in Houston at the time."
f000525,1952.360,1959.120,"When my mom get in the car and when there are first frost to drive me to school, turning the windshield wiper, there’d been oil slick in the window."
f000526,1959.120,1962.920,"That’s why so many people in my state were dying and getting cancer."
f000527,1962.920,1966.240,"The fact is those frontline communities, it’s not a matter of what you’re paying them."
f000528,1966.240,1968.360,"It matters how you keep them safe."
f000529,1968.360,1969.480,"What do you do?"
f000530,1969.480,1976.160,"You impose restrictions on the pollutions that if the pollutants coming out of those fence line communities."
f000531,1976.160,1976.960,"Okay."
f000532,1976.960,1978.560,"I have one final question called."
f000533,1978.560,1979.640,"Would he close down the oil industry?"
f000534,1979.640,1980.120,"It falls-"
f000535,1980.120,1980.960,"Would you close dow the oil industry?"
f000536,1980.960,1984.000,"By the way, I have a transition from the old industry, yes."
f000537,1984.000,1985.760,"Oh, that’s a big statement."
f000538,1985.760,1986.440,"I will transition."
f000539,1986.440,1987.120,"It is a big statement."
f000540,1987.120,1987.840,"That’s a big statement."
f000541,1987.840,1988.640,"Because I would stop."
f000542,1988.640,1990.080,"Why would you do that?"
f000543,1990.080,1992.640,"Because the oil industry pollutes, significantly."
f000544,1992.640,1992.920,"Oh, I see."
f000545,1992.920,1993.240,"Okay."
f000546,1993.240,1994.560,"Here’s the deal-"
f000547,1994.560,1995.680,"That’s a big statement."
f000548,1995.680,2007.600,"Well if you let me finish the statement, because it has to be replaced by renewable energy over time, over time, and I’d stopped giving to the oil industry, I’d stop giving them federal subsidies."
f000549,2007.600,2011.880,"You won’t get federal subsidies to the gas, oh, excuse me to solar and wind."
f000550,2011.880,2012.040,"Yeah."
f000551,2012.040,2013.560,"Why are we giving it to oil industry?"
f000552,2013.560,2015.800,"We actually give it to solar and wind."
f000553,2015.800,2016.760,"That’s maybe the biggest statement."
f000554,2016.760,2018.280,"In terms of business, that’s the biggest statement."
f000555,2018.280,2018.360,"Okay."
f000556,2018.360,2020.120,"Because basically what he’s saying is-"
f000557,2020.120,2021.280,"We have one final question, Mr. President."
f000558,2021.280,2022.480,"… he is going to destroy the oil industry."
f000559,2022.480,2023.160,"Will you remember that Texas?"
f000560,2023.160,2025.760,"Will you remember that Pennsylvania, Oklahoma?"
f000561,2025.760,2029.320,"Okay, Vice President Biden, let me give you 10 seconds."
f000562,2029.320,2029.920,"Okay."
f000563,2029.920,2031.160,"Remember that Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, is-"
f000564,2031.160,2033.480,"Vice President Biden, let me give you 10 seconds to respond-"
f000565,2033.480,2034.280,"Ohio."
f000566,2034.280,2035.320,"… and then I have to get to the final question."
f000567,2035.320,2036.240,"Vice President Biden."
f000568,2036.240,2043.920,"He takes everything out of context, but the point is, look, we have to move toward net zero emissions."
f000569,2043.920,2049.800,"The first place to do that by the year 2035 is in energy production, by 2050 totally."
f000570,2049.800,2050.480,"All right."
f000571,2050.480,2052.400,"One final question to both of you-"
f000572,2052.400,2053.000,"Is he going to get China to do it?"
f000573,2053.000,2053.240,"No, we’re finished with this-"
f000574,2053.240,2054.360,"Is he going to get China to do it?"
f000575,2054.360,2056.720,"We have to move onto our final question."
