f000001,0.000,5.800,"Gentlemen, a lot of people been waiting for this night, so let’s get going."
f000002,5.800,9.000,"Our first subject is the Supreme Court."
f000003,9.000,17.880,"President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court."
f000004,17.880,25.480,"You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate’s to consider a nominee to the Court."
f000005,25.480,35.000,"Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the President and Republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power."
f000006,35.000,42.080,"My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong?"
f000007,42.080,47.160,"And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court?"
f000008,47.160,50.280,"President Trump, in this first segment, you go first."
f000009,50.280,51.240,"Two minutes."
f000010,51.240,52.280,"Thank you very much, Chris."
f000011,52.280,53.480,"I will tell you very simply."
f000012,53.480,55.200,"We won the election."
f000013,55.200,57.360,"Elections have consequences."
f000014,57.360,64.880,"We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all."
f000015,64.880,68.640,"Top, top academic, good in every way."
f000016,68.640,70.000,"Good in every way."
f000017,70.000,76.560,"In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places."
f000018,76.560,78.360,"So I think she’s going to be fantastic."
f000019,78.360,80.160,"We have plenty of time."
f000020,80.160,82.440,"Even if we did it after the election itself."
f000021,82.440,85.160,"I have a lot of time after the election, as you know."
f000022,85.160,87.680,"So I think that she will be outstanding."
f000023,87.680,92.440,"She’s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court."
f000024,92.440,93.280,"We really feel that."
f000025,93.280,99.400,"We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she’s the single greatest student he’s ever had."
f000026,99.400,102.760,"He’s been a professor for a long time at a great school."
f000027,102.760,110.800,"And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise."
f000028,110.800,113.960,"And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn’t even think about not doing it."
f000029,113.960,116.720,"The only difference is they’d try and do it faster."
f000030,116.720,118.720,"There’s no way they would give it up."
f000031,118.720,124.440,"They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn’t have the election so they were stopped."
f000032,124.440,127.080,"And probably that would happen in reverse, also."
f000033,127.080,128.880,"Definitely would happen in reverse."
f000034,128.880,131.360,"So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris."
f000035,131.360,134.360,"President Trump, thank you."
f000036,134.360,136.400,"Same question to you, Vice President Biden."
f000037,136.400,138.240,"You have two minutes."
f000038,138.240,144.400,"Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President."
f000039,144.400,145.800,"Thank you, Joe."
f000040,145.800,158.520,"The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States."
f000041,158.520,163.040,"They’re not going to get that chance now because we’re in the middle of an election already."
f000042,163.040,164.360,"The election has already started."
f000043,164.360,170.920,"Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait."
f000044,170.920,181.360,"We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that’s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President."
f000045,181.360,187.520,"Now, what’s at stake here is the President’s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act."
f000046,187.520,191.920,"He’s been running on that, he ran on that and he’s been governing on that."
f000047,191.920,206.920,"He’s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court."
f000048,206.920,212.880,"And the justice, I’m not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person."
f000049,212.880,220.160,"But she’s written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional."
f000050,220.160,224.000,"The other thing that’s on the court, and if it’s struck down, what happens?"
f000051,224.000,226.200,"Women’s rights are fundamentally changed."
f000052,226.200,232.880,"Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy."
f000053,232.880,238.240,"They’re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets."
f000054,238.240,248.160,"And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there’s a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they’ll be taken away as well."
f000055,248.160,251.560,"Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this."
f000056,251.560,256.320,"And so it’s just not appropriate to do this before this election."
f000057,256.320,261.800,"If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward."
f000058,261.800,263.400,"If not, we should wait until February."
f000059,263.400,267.000,"There aren’t a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions."
f000060,267.000,271.760,"As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say."
f000061,271.760,285.520,"Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years."
f000062,285.520,286.720,"We’re not elected for three years."
f000063,286.720,288.600,"I’m not elected for three years."
f000064,288.600,290.560,"So we have the Senate, we have a President-"
f000065,290.560,291.920,"He’s elected to the next election."
f000066,291.920,297.000,"During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening."
f000067,297.000,298.320,"I’m not elected for three years."
f000068,298.320,299.960,"I’m elected for four years."
f000069,299.960,302.280,"Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong."
f000070,302.280,305.560,"I don’t know where you got that number."
f000071,305.560,313.040,"The bigger problem that you have is that you’re going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they’re very happy this."
f000072,313.040,314.480,"That’s simply not true."
f000073,314.480,316.200,"Well, you’re certainly going to socialist."
f000074,316.200,317.680,"You’re going to socialist-"
f000075,317.680,320.080,"Gentlemen, we’re now into open discussion."
f000076,320.080,321.200,"Open discussion."
f000077,321.200,322.400,"Open discussion, yes, I agree."
f000078,322.400,323.320,"Go ahead, Vice President."
f000079,323.320,327.480,"Number one, he knows what I proposed."
f000080,327.480,332.640,"What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it."
f000081,332.640,334.480,"We do not wipe any."
f000082,334.480,344.360,"And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still."
f000083,344.360,345.520,"They can."
f000084,345.520,346.520,"They do."
f000085,346.520,347.920,"They will under my proposal."
f000086,347.920,350.240,"That’s not what you’ve said and it’s not what your party is saying."
f000087,350.240,351.200,"That is simply a lie."
f000088,351.200,351.840,"Your party doesn’t say it."
f000089,351.840,355.480,"Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare."
f000090,355.480,356.000,"The party is me."
f000091,356.000,357.440,"Right now, I am the Democratic Party."
f000092,357.440,358.360,"And they’re going to dominate you, Joe."
f000093,358.360,359.000,"You know that."
f000094,359.000,361.400,"I am the Democratic Party right now."
f000095,361.400,361.840,"Not according to Harris."
f000096,361.840,367.160,"The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of."
f000097,367.160,368.960,"Now, here’s the deal."
f000098,368.960,374.160,"The deal is that it’s going to wipe out pre-existing conditions."
f000099,374.160,381.520,"And, by the way, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived?"
f000100,381.520,384.480,"Well, there’s seven million people that contracted COVID."
f000101,384.480,388.880,"What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?"
f000102,388.880,395.160,"Joe, you’ve had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn’t provide them proper healthcare in the military."
f000103,395.160,396.120,"So don’t tell me about this."
f000104,396.120,397.360,"I’m happy to talk about this."
f000105,397.360,403.280,"And if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw."
f000106,403.280,406.520,"You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected."
f000107,406.520,409.400,"You didn’t want me to ban Europe."
f000108,409.400,411.200,"All right, gentlemen, Mr. President."
f000109,411.200,413.240,"You would have been much later, Joe, much later."
f000110,413.240,413.520,"Mr. President."
f000111,413.520,414.920,"We’re talking about two million people."
f000112,414.920,416.720,"You’re not going to be able to shut him up."
f000113,416.720,422.000,"Mr. President, as the moderator, we are going to talk about COVID in the next segment."
f000114,422.000,422.120,"But go ahead."
f000115,422.120,422.840,"Let me finish."
f000116,422.840,426.480,"The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade."
f000117,426.480,433.080,"That’s on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that’s also at stake right now."
f000118,433.080,434.560,"And so the election is all-"
f000119,434.560,435.640,"You don’t know what’s on the ballot."
f000120,435.640,438.040,"Why is it on the ballot?"
f000121,438.040,439.200,"Why is it on the ballot?"
f000122,439.200,440.160,"It’s not on the ballot."
f000123,440.160,441.000,"It’s on the ballot in the court."
f000124,441.000,442.360,"I don’t think so."
f000125,442.360,442.720,"In the court."
f000126,442.720,444.520,"There’s nothing happening there."
f000127,444.520,446.920,"Donald would you just be quiet for a minute."
f000128,446.920,448.920,"You don’t know her view on Roe V. Wade?"
f000129,448.920,449.880,"You don’t know here view."
f000130,449.880,450.640,"Well, all right."
f000131,450.640,451.120,"All right."
f000132,451.120,451.880,"Let’s talk."
f000133,451.880,455.480,"We’ve got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen."
f000134,455.480,457.240,"We’ve got a lot of time."
f000135,457.240,460.640,"On healthcare, and then we’ll come back to Roe V. Wade."
f000136,460.640,461.120,"All right."
f000137,461.120,474.520,"Mr. President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare."
f000138,474.520,475.120,"That’s right."
f000139,475.120,476.200,"You have spent the last week-"
f000140,476.200,478.240,"Because they want to give good healthcare."
f000141,478.240,479.800,"If I may ask my question, sir."
f000142,479.800,480.880,"Good healthcare."
f000143,480.880,492.280,"Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare."
f000144,492.280,493.520,"Yes, I have."
f000145,493.520,495.360,"Of course, I have."
f000146,495.360,496.320,"The individual mandate."
f000147,496.320,497.320,"[crosstalk 00:11:26] when I finish I’m going to give an opportunity-"
f000148,497.320,498.120,"Excuse me."
f000149,498.120,501.320,"I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare."
f000150,501.320,502.120,"That’s not a comprehensive place."
f000151,502.120,503.200,"That is absolutely a big thing."
f000152,503.200,504.760,"That was the worst part of Obamacare."
f000153,504.760,505.320,"I didn’t ask, sir."
f000154,505.320,506.960,"Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare."
f000155,506.960,507.680,"You’re debating him not me."
f000156,507.680,509.480,"Let me ask my question."
f000157,509.480,510.560,"Well, I’ll ask Joe."
f000158,510.560,513.760,"The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare."
f000159,513.760,514.040,"Mr. President."
f000160,514.040,514.440,"I got rid of it."
f000161,514.440,514.920,"And we will protect people."
f000162,514.920,521.480,"Mr. President, I’m the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer."
f000163,521.480,521.680,"Go ahead."
f000164,521.680,541.520,"You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate."
f000165,541.520,545.160,"So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?"
f000166,545.160,548.200,"Well, first of all, I guess I’m debating you, not him, but that’s okay."
f000167,548.200,548.800,"I’m not surprised."
f000168,548.800,550.520,"Let me just tell you something."
f000169,550.520,552.120,"There’s nothing symbolic."
f000170,552.120,554.000,"I’m cutting drug prices."
f000171,554.000,559.040,"I’m going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you’re going against big pharma."
f000172,559.040,562.760,"Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%."
f000173,562.760,567.200,"You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn’t do it."
f000174,567.200,567.920,"Nobody’s done it."
f000175,567.920,569.080,"So we’re cutting healthcare."
f000176,569.080,570.960,"What about pre-existing conditions?"
f000177,570.960,572.200,"All of the things that we’ve done."
f000178,572.200,572.880,"He has not done healthcare."
f000179,572.880,573.800,"I’ll give you an example."
f000180,573.800,577.400,"Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost."
f000181,577.400,581.800,"I’m getting it for so cheap it’s like water, you want to know the truth."
f000182,581.800,582.680,"So cheap."
f000183,582.680,585.080,"Take a look at all of the drugs that what we’re doing."
f000184,585.080,592.920,"Prescription drug prices, we’re going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do."
f000185,592.920,594.600,"Okay, like I say, this is open discussion."
f000186,594.600,595.920,"This is big stuff."
f000187,595.920,597.240,"Sir, you’ll be happy."
f000188,597.240,606.000,"I’m about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare."
f000189,606.000,606.480,"Yes."
f000190,606.480,612.760,"And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance."
f000191,612.760,613.600,"It is not."
f000192,613.600,616.200,"If I start asking the question."
f000193,616.200,618.440,"That’s not what your party says, by the way."
f000194,618.440,621.960,"And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health."
f000195,621.960,622.680,"It does not."
f000196,622.680,633.680,"It’s only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid."
f000197,633.680,641.160,"Anyone who qualifies for Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option."
f000198,641.160,645.520,"The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option."
f000199,645.520,646.080,"Number one."
f000200,646.080,646.600,"Number two."
f000201,646.600,652.120,"Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who’s far left, on the manifesto, we call it."
f000202,652.120,654.080,"And that gives you socialized medicine."
f000203,654.080,654.840,"Look, hey."
f000204,654.840,655.480,"Are you saying you didn’t agree?"
f000205,655.480,656.280,"I’m not going to listen to him."
f000206,656.280,659.000,"The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders."
f000207,659.000,659.400,"Not by much."
f000208,659.400,660.680,"I beat him by a whole hell of a lot."
f000209,660.680,662.040,"Not by much."
f000210,662.040,664.320,"I’m here standing facing you, old buddy."
f000211,664.320,666.520,"If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary."
f000212,666.520,667.600,"All he knows how to do-"
f000213,667.600,669.440,"On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky."
f000214,669.440,669.960,"Look he’s the deal."
f000215,669.960,671.040,"I got very lucky."
f000216,671.040,672.240,"I’m going to get very lucky tonight as well."
f000217,672.240,672.760,"With what?"
f000218,672.760,674.760,"And tonight I’m going to make sure."
f000219,674.760,674.960,"With what?"
f000220,674.960,677.120,"Because here’s the deal, here’s the deal."
f000221,677.120,680.640,"The fact is that everything he’s saying so far is simply a lie."
f000222,680.640,682.320,"I’m not here to call out his lies."
f000223,682.320,683.640,"Everybody knows he’s a liar."
f000224,683.640,684.760,"But you agree."
f000225,684.760,686.920,"Joe, you’re the liar."
f000226,686.920,690.120,"You graduated last in your class not first in your class."
f000227,690.120,691.480,"God, I want to make sure-"
f000228,691.480,693.320,"Mr. President, can you let him finish, sir?"
f000229,693.320,694.560,"No, he doesn’t know how to do that."
f000230,694.560,695.600,"You’d be surprised."
f000231,695.600,696.840,"You’d be surprised."
f000232,696.840,697.880,"Go ahead, Joe."
f000233,697.880,700.560,"The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time."
f000234,700.560,704.480,"Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto."
f000235,704.480,706.240,"There is no manifesto, number one."
f000236,706.240,707.560,"Please let him speak, Mr. President."
f000237,707.560,707.960,"Number two."
f000238,707.960,708.800,"He just lost the left."
f000239,708.800,710.440,"Number two."
f000240,710.440,711.840,"You just lost the left."
f000241,711.840,722.880,"You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan [crosstalk 00:15:10], they call it socialized medicine."
f000242,722.880,723.160,"Mr. President."
f000243,723.160,729.000,"I’ll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare."
f000244,729.000,730.520,"Who is, Bernie?"
f000245,730.520,738.800,"Because he, in fact, already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession."
f000246,738.800,739.640,"Number one."
f000247,739.640,746.240,"Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away."
f000248,746.240,749.600,"He won’t ever look you in the eye and say that’s what he wants to do."
f000249,749.600,750.120,"Take it away."
f000250,750.120,754.400,"No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good."
f000251,754.400,755.400,"He doesn’t know how."
f000252,755.400,756.680,"He doesn’t know how to do that."
f000253,756.680,757.400,"I’ve already fixed it."
f000254,757.400,758.760,"He has never offered a plan."
f000255,758.760,759.880,"We’ve already fixed it to an extent."
f000256,759.880,764.280,"Obamacare, as you might know but probably don’t, Obamacare is no good."
f000257,764.280,766.920,"Gentlemen, you realize if you’re both speaking at the same time."
f000258,766.920,767.720,"Let the President."
f000259,767.720,768.400,"Go ahead, sir."
f000260,768.400,769.840,"Obamacare is no good."
f000261,769.840,772.680,"We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on."
f000262,772.680,774.800,"We took away the individual mandate."
f000263,774.800,778.600,"We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate."
f000264,778.600,781.040,"Listen, this is the way it is."
f000265,781.040,789.760,"And that destroyed … They shouldn’t even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly?"
f000266,789.760,792.560,"If I run it badly, they’ll probably blame him, but they’ll blame me."
f000267,792.560,794.080,"But more importantly, I want to help people."
f000268,794.080,794.560,"Okay."
f000269,794.560,798.400,"I said, “You’ve got to run it so well.” And I just had a meeting with them."
f000270,798.400,803.320,"They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it’s a disaster."
f000271,803.320,804.600,"It’s too expensive."
f000272,804.600,807.040,"Premiums are too high, that it doesn’t work."
f000273,807.040,809.320,"So we do want to get rid of it."
f000274,809.320,811.240,"Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that’s cheaper and better."
f000275,811.240,813.160,"I understand that, sir."
f000276,813.160,814.280,"But I have to give you roughly equal time."
f000277,814.280,814.880,"Go ahead."
f000278,814.880,816.840,"Please let the Vice President talk, sir."
f000279,816.840,816.880,"Good."
f000280,816.880,819.840,"He has no plan for healthcare."
f000281,819.840,821.200,"Of course, we do."
f000282,821.200,821.960,"Please."
f000283,821.960,824.600,"He sends out wishful thinking."
f000284,824.600,827.120,"He has Executive Orders that have no power."
f000285,827.120,829.200,"He hasn’t lowered drug costs for anybody."
f000286,829.200,832.240,"He’s been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected."
f000287,832.240,835.640,"He has none, like almost everything else he talks about."
f000288,835.640,837.800,"He does not have a plan."
f000289,837.800,839.320,"He doesn’t have a plan."
f000290,839.320,842.680,"And the fact is this man doesn’t know what he’s talking about."
f000291,842.680,842.720,"[crosstalk 00:17:14]."
f000292,842.720,845.080,"All right, I have one final question for you."
f000293,845.080,845.720,"Sure."
f000294,845.720,864.400,"Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans, we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here, if Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there."
f000295,864.400,866.560,"You call this a distraction by the President."
f000296,866.560,868.720,"But, in fact, it wasn’t brought up by the President."
f000297,868.720,873.040,"It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress."
f000298,873.040,884.040,"So my question to you is, you have refused in the past to talk about it, are you willing to tell the American tonight whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court?"
f000299,884.040,886.640,"Whatever position I take on that, that’ll become the issue."
f000300,886.640,888.720,"The issue is the American people should speak."
f000301,888.720,890.960,"You should go out and vote."
f000302,890.960,892.840,"You’re voting now."
f000303,892.840,896.000,"Vote and let your Senators know strongly how you feel."
f000304,896.000,897.040,"Are you going to pack the court?"
f000305,897.040,897.840,"Vote now."
f000306,897.840,898.960,"Are you going to pack the court?"
f000307,898.960,901.760,"Make sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators."
f000308,901.760,902.760,"He doesn’t want to answer the question."
f000309,902.760,903.640,"I’m not going to answer the question."
f000310,903.640,904.560,"Why wouldn’t you answer that question?"
f000311,904.560,906.920,"You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices."
f000312,906.920,908.080,"Radical left."
f000313,908.080,909.200,"Will you shut up, man?"
f000314,909.200,910.960,"Listen, who is on your list, Joe?"
f000315,910.960,912.360,"Who’s on your list?"
f000316,912.360,913.480,"Gentlemen, I think we’ve ended this-"
f000317,913.480,914.640,"This is so un-Presidential."
f000318,914.640,915.760,"He’s going to pack the court."
f000319,915.760,917.320,"He is not going to give a list."
f000320,917.320,918.280,"We have ended the segment."
f000321,918.280,920.080,"We’re going to move on to the second segment."
f000322,920.080,923.000,"That was really a productive segment, wasn’t it?"
f000323,923.000,924.840,"Keep yapping, man."
f000324,924.840,926.000,"The people understand, Joe."
f000325,926.000,926.600,"They sure do."
f000326,926.600,928.520,"47 years, you’ve done nothing."
f000327,928.520,929.080,"They’re understand."
f000328,929.080,934.640,"All right, the second subject is COVID-19, which is an awfully serious subject."
f000329,934.640,937.680,"So let’s try to be serious about it."
f000330,937.680,947.080,"We have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died."
f000331,947.080,958.400,"Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal."
f000332,958.400,976.880,"My question for both of you is, based on what you have said and done so far, and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward?"
f000333,976.880,980.520,"In this case, the question goes to you first, sir."
f000334,980.520,981.920,"Two minutes, uninterrupted."
f000335,981.920,983.280,"Good luck."
f000336,983.280,985.760,"200,000 dead."
f000337,985.760,989.080,"As you said, over seven million infected in the United States."
f000338,989.080,995.920,"We, in fact, have 4% of the world’s population, 20% of the deaths."
f000339,995.920,1000.240,"40,000 people a day are contracting COVID."
f000340,1000.240,1005.360,"In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying."
f000341,1005.360,1012.440,"When he was presented with that number, he said, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because you are who you are."
f000342,1012.440,1013.880,"That’s why it is."
f000343,1013.880,1016.640,"The President has no plan."
f000344,1016.640,1018.840,"He hasn’t laid out anything."
f000345,1018.840,1023.320,"He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was."
f000346,1023.320,1026.000,"He knew it was a deadly disease."
f000347,1026.000,1027.000,"What did he do?"
f000348,1027.000,1029.520,"He’s on tape as acknowledging he knew it."
f000349,1029.520,1035.800,"He said he didn’t tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn’t want to panic the American people."
f000350,1035.800,1036.800,"You don’t panic."
f000351,1036.800,1037.320,"He panicked."
f000352,1037.320,1039.480,"In addition to that, what did he do?"
f000353,1039.480,1049.360,"He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was."
f000354,1049.360,1051.800,"He did not even ask Xi to do that."
f000355,1051.800,1052.240,"Wrong."
f000356,1052.240,1055.080,"He told us what a great job Xi was doing."
f000357,1055.080,1059.080,"He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us."
f000358,1059.080,1060.640,"And what did he do then?"
f000359,1060.640,1061.520,"He then did nothing."
f000360,1061.520,1063.600,"He waited and waited and waited."
f000361,1063.600,1064.640,"He still doesn’t have a plan."
f000362,1064.640,1064.960,"Wrong."
f000363,1064.960,1065.960,"Sir, it’s his two minutes."
f000364,1065.960,1066.520,"It’s so wrong."
f000365,1066.520,1070.760,"I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing."
f000366,1070.760,1074.400,"And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing."
f000367,1074.400,1077.560,"We should be providing all the protective gear possible."
f000368,1077.560,1085.400,"We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open."
f000369,1085.400,1087.440,"Open schools cost a lot of money."
f000370,1087.440,1095.840,"You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives."
f000371,1095.840,1097.320,"So, if we would have listened to you."
f000372,1097.320,1098.400,"Wait, wait."
f000373,1098.400,1099.840,"You have two minutes, sir."
f000374,1099.840,1108.640,"If we would’ve listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000."
f000375,1108.640,1110.280,"And one person is too much."
f000376,1110.280,1111.720,"It’s China’s fault."
f000377,1111.720,1113.400,"It should have never happened."
f000378,1113.400,1116.760,"They stopped it from going in, but it was China’s fault."
f000379,1116.760,1120.000,"And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don’t know how many people died in China."
f000380,1120.000,1121.840,"You don’t know how many people died in Russia."
f000381,1121.840,1123.760,"You don’t know how many people died in India."
f000382,1123.760,1126.400,"They don’t exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand."
f000383,1126.400,1130.960,"But if you look at what we’ve done, I closed it and you said, “He’s xenophobic."
f000384,1130.960,1135.160,"He’s a racist and he’s xenophobic,” because you didn’t think I should have closed our country."
f000385,1135.160,1135.440,"Wait a minute."
f000386,1135.440,1136.080,"Sir, it’s his two minutes."
f000387,1136.080,1141.160,"You didn’t think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible."
f000388,1141.160,1143.360,"You wouldn’t have closed it for another two months."
f000389,1143.360,1155.160,"By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, “President Trump saved thousands of lives.” Many of your Democrat Governors said, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We worked with the Governor."
f000390,1155.160,1156.680,"Oh really, go take a look."
f000391,1156.680,1159.400,"The Governors said I did a phenomenal job."
f000392,1159.400,1160.960,"Most of them said that."
f000393,1160.960,1169.320,"In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We did."
f000394,1169.320,1170.480,"We got the gowns."
f000395,1170.480,1171.480,"We got the masks."
f000396,1171.480,1172.680,"We made the ventilators."
f000397,1172.680,1174.040,"You wouldn’t have made ventilators."
f000398,1174.040,1176.360,"And now we’re weeks away from a vaccine."
f000399,1176.360,1178.480,"We’re doing therapeutics already."
f000400,1178.480,1180.720,"Fewer people are dying when they get sick."
f000401,1180.720,1182.560,"Far fewer people are dying."
f000402,1182.560,1184.040,"We’ve done a great job."
f000403,1184.040,1189.920,"The only thing I haven’t done a good job, and that’s because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it."
f000404,1189.920,1191.000,"It’s just fake news."
f000405,1191.000,1195.640,"They give you good press, they give me bad press because that’s the way it is, unfortunately."
f000406,1195.640,1196.560,"But let me just say something."
f000407,1196.560,1197.120,"I don’t care."
f000408,1197.120,1198.040,"I’ve gotten used to it."
f000409,1198.040,1201.080,"But I’ll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did."
f000410,1201.080,1202.320,"You don’t have it in your blood."
f000411,1202.320,1203.520,"You could’ve never done that, Joe."
f000412,1203.520,1205.800,"I know how to do the job."
f000413,1205.800,1206.960,"I know how to get the job done."
f000414,1206.960,1209.200,"Well, you didn’t do very well in Swine Flu."
f000415,1209.200,1211.760,"H1-N1, you were a disaster."
f000416,1211.760,1214.320,"Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster."
f000417,1214.320,1217.280,"14,000 people died, not 200,000."
f000418,1217.280,1219.320,"A far less lethal disease, by the way."
f000419,1219.320,1220.520,"Sir, you made a point."
f000420,1220.520,1222.040,"Let him answer it."
f000421,1222.040,1225.720,"And there was no one … We didn’t shut down the economy."
f000422,1225.720,1228.800,"This is his economy he shut down."
f000423,1228.800,1232.480,"The reason it’s shut down is because, look, you folks at home."
f000424,1232.480,1237.800,"How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID?"
f000425,1237.800,1246.400,"How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn’t even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye?"
f000426,1246.400,1249.120,"We would have lost far more people, far more people."
f000427,1249.120,1250.480,"You would have been months late."
f000428,1250.480,1252.640,"You’re months behind me, Joe."
f000429,1252.640,1259.480,"His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year."
f000430,1259.480,1263.840,"And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers."
f000431,1263.840,1265.080,"Just a mask."
f000432,1265.080,1271.880,"And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we’re for a vaccine, but I don’t trust him at all."
f000433,1271.880,1272.360,"Nor do you."
f000434,1272.360,1273.440,"I know you don’t."
f000435,1273.440,1275.000,"What we trust is a scientist."
f000436,1275.000,1277.360,"You don’t trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?"
f000437,1277.360,1279.880,"Okay, gentlemen, gentlemen."
f000438,1279.880,1286.800,"Let me move on to questions about the future because you both have touched on two of the questions I’m going to ask."
f000439,1286.800,1295.720,"Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your governments own top scientists."
f000440,1295.720,1303.480,"The week before last, the Head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public."
f000441,1303.480,1304.960,"You said that he was confused and mistaken."
f000442,1304.960,1306.360,"Those were your two words."
f000443,1306.360,1311.320,"But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your Operation Warp Speed, has said exactly the same thing."
f000444,1311.320,1313.600,"Are they both wrong?"
f000445,1313.600,1319.280,"Well, I’ve spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner."
f000446,1319.280,1323.840,"It’s a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives."
f000447,1323.840,1324.680,"God."
f000448,1324.680,1326.520,"It is a very political thing."
f000449,1326.520,1333.360,"I’ve spoken to Pfizer, I’ve spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others."
f000450,1333.360,1335.200,"They can go faster than that by a lot."
f000451,1335.200,1341.280,"It’s become very political because the left… Or I don’t know if I call them left, I don’t know what I call them."
f000452,1341.280,1345.000,"So you’re suggesting that the head of your Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Slaoui-"
f000453,1345.000,1346.360,"I disagree with him."
f000454,1346.360,1348.120,"No, I disagree with both of them."
f000455,1348.120,1349.080,"And he didn’t say that."
f000456,1349.080,1351.520,"He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner."
f000457,1351.520,1352.960,"I had him in my office two days ago."
f000458,1352.960,1356.920,"He talked about the summer, sir, before it’s generally available, just like Dr. Redfield."
f000459,1356.920,1361.720,"Because he said it’s a possibility that we’ll have the answer before November 1st."
f000460,1361.720,1362.560,"It could also be after that."
f000461,1362.560,1363.920,"I’m talking about when it’s generally available, not-"
f000462,1363.920,1366.000,"Well, we’re going to deliver it right away."
f000463,1366.000,1367.200,"We have the military all set up."
f000464,1367.200,1368.840,"Logistically, they’re all set up."
f000465,1368.840,1373.760,"We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day."
f000466,1373.760,1374.760,"They’re going to be delivering-"
f000467,1374.760,1376.400,"This is the same man who told you-"
f000468,1376.400,1377.360,"It’s all set up."
f000469,1377.360,1379.800,"… by Easter, this would be gone away."
f000470,1379.800,1381.960,"By the warm weather, it’d be gone."
f000471,1381.960,1383.480,"Miraculous, like a miracle."
f000472,1383.480,1387.400,"And by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm, and that would take care of it."
f000473,1387.400,1388.680,"This is the same man."
f000474,1388.680,1389.960,"That was said sarcastically, and you know that."
f000475,1389.960,1391.280,"That was said sarcastically."
f000476,1391.280,1392.280,"So here’s the deal."
f000477,1392.280,1396.360,"This man is talking about a vaccine."
f000478,1396.360,1409.920,"Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine."
f000479,1409.920,1411.560,"And pray God we will."
f000480,1411.560,1412.400,"Pray God we will."
f000481,1412.400,1413.800,"Mr. Vice President, I want to pick up-"
f000482,1413.800,1415.600,"You’ll have the vaccine sooner than that."
f000483,1415.600,1417.120,"I want to pick up on this question though."
f000484,1417.120,1420.880,"You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can’t trust President Trump."
f000485,1420.880,1422.680,"In fact, you said that again tonight."
f000486,1422.680,1441.680,"Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts quote, “Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.” Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate, Senator Harris, contributing to that fear?"
f000487,1441.680,1443.640,"No more than the question you just asked him."
f000488,1443.640,1448.920,"You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists."
f000489,1448.920,1449.720,"But you’re saying you can’t-"
f000490,1449.720,1450.400,"Everybody knows-"
f000491,1450.400,1452.320,"Or Senator Harris is saying you can’t trust the scientist."
f000492,1452.320,1452.920,"Well, no, no."
f000493,1452.920,1454.360,"You can trust the scientist."
f000494,1454.360,1455.440,"She didn’t say that."
f000495,1455.440,1456.040,"You can trust the-"
f000496,1456.040,1460.760,"She said that public health experts quote, “Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.”"
f000497,1460.760,1461.200,"Yes."
f000498,1461.200,1469.440,"Well, that’s what he’s going to try to do, but there’s thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital that don’t work for him."
f000499,1469.440,1471.440,"Their job doesn’t depend on him."
f000500,1471.440,1474.280,"They’re the people… And by the way-"
f000501,1474.280,1476.440,"We spoke to the scientists that are in charge-"
f000502,1476.440,1476.800,"By the way-"
f000503,1476.800,1478.520,"… they will have the vaccine very soon."
f000504,1478.520,1479.560,"Let him finish."
f000505,1479.560,1488.480,"Do you believe for a moment what he’s telling you in light of all the lies he’s told you about the whole issue relating to COVID?"
f000506,1488.480,1498.640,"He still hasn’t even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn’t even tell you."
f000507,1498.640,1500.920,"He’s on record as saying it."
f000508,1500.920,1503.440,"He panicked or he just looked at the stock market."
f000509,1503.440,1504.280,"One of the two."
f000510,1504.280,1505.200,"Because guess what?"
f000511,1505.200,1510.720,"A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker-"
f000512,1510.720,1511.480,"Mr. President?"
f000513,1511.480,1513.520,"Did you use the word smart?"
f000514,1513.520,1518.640,"So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college."
f000515,1518.640,1520.480,"You didn’t go to Delaware State."
f000516,1520.480,1524.560,"You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class."
f000517,1524.560,1526.320,"Don’t ever use the word smart with me."
f000518,1526.320,1527.560,"Don’t ever use that word."
f000519,1527.560,1528.360,"Oh, give me a break."
f000520,1528.360,1529.280,"Because you know what?"
f000521,1529.280,1530.640,"There’s nothing smart about you, Joe."
f000522,1530.640,1532.120,"47 years you’ve done nothing."
f000523,1532.120,1533.640,"Well, let’s have this debate-"
f000524,1533.640,1535.400,"Let me just tell you something, Joe."
f000525,1535.400,1543.040,"If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country."
f000526,1543.040,1545.960,"And by the way, now it’s being built again and it’s going up fast."
f000527,1545.960,1547.440,"We’ll get to the economy in the next segment, sir."
f000528,1547.440,1547.920,"Okay."
f000529,1547.920,1549.000,"It’s going up fast."
f000530,1549.000,1549.880,"I look forward to talking about it."
f000531,1549.880,1550.280,"Okay."
f000532,1550.280,1564.040,"When it comes to how the virus has been handled so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president."
f000533,1564.040,1566.320,"I want to quickly go through several of those."
f000534,1566.320,1567.160,"Reopenings."
f000535,1567.160,1574.480,"Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and schools."
f000536,1574.480,1575.080,"Why, sir?"
f000537,1575.080,1576.640,"Because he doesn’t have a plan."
f000538,1576.640,1579.040,"If I were running it, I’d know what the plan is."
f000539,1579.040,1587.920,"You’ve got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need."
f000540,1587.920,1589.320,"You have to provide them classic-"
f000541,1589.320,1590.200,"Tell that to Nancy Pelosi."
f000542,1590.200,1592.720,"Will he just shush for a minute?"
f000543,1592.720,1596.040,"Tell that to Nancy Pelosi, and Schumer [crosstalk 00:04:52] Chuck."
f000544,1596.040,1598.760,"Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, they have a plan."
f000545,1598.760,1600.680,"He won’t even meet with them."
f000546,1600.680,1603.400,"The Republicans won’t meet in the Senate."
f000547,1603.400,1605.160,"He sits in his golf course."
f000548,1605.160,1606.920,"Well, I mean, literally, think about it."
f000549,1606.920,1607.520,"Think about it."
f000550,1607.520,1609.560,"You probably play more than I do, Joe."
f000551,1609.560,1612.040,"What about this question of reopenings and the fact-"
f000552,1612.040,1619.160,"Well, he wants to shut down this country and I want to keep it open, and we did a great thing by shutting it down-"
f000553,1619.160,1620.120,"You just admitted you’d shut it down."
f000554,1620.120,1620.600,"Wait a minute, Joe."
f000555,1620.600,1623.360,"Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second."
f000556,1623.360,1626.320,"He wants to shut down the country."
f000557,1626.320,1627.320,"We just went through it."
f000558,1627.320,1629.480,"We had to, because we didn’t know anything about the disease."
f000559,1629.480,1636.640,"Now we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable."
f000560,1636.640,1637.600,"We learned a lot."
f000561,1637.600,1641.240,"Young children aren’t, even younger people aren’t."
f000562,1641.240,1643.680,"We’ve learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down."
f000563,1643.680,1647.280,"More people will be hurt by continuing."
f000564,1647.280,1656.480,"If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd."
f000565,1656.480,1657.120,"All right."
f000566,1657.120,1658.000,"I want to move onto another-"
f000567,1658.000,1659.200,"Because it’s a political thing."
f000568,1659.200,1660.720,"I want to move onto another subject."
f000569,1660.720,1661.920,"I got to respond to that."
f000570,1661.920,1662.120,"I want to move-"
f000571,1662.120,1662.880,"But those states-"
f000572,1662.880,1664.320,"Gentlemen, I want to move onto another subject."
f000573,1664.320,1666.440,"Those states are not doing well that are shut down right now."
f000574,1666.440,1666.840,"I got to respond to that."
f000575,1666.840,1668.320,"He wants to shut down the whole country."
f000576,1668.320,1674.520,"President Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer."
f000577,1674.520,1680.480,"And in fact, recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates."
f000578,1680.480,1681.880,"Are you questioning the efficacy of masks?"
f000579,1681.880,1683.800,"No, I think masks are okay."
f000580,1683.800,1686.640,"You have to understand, if you look… I mean, I have a mask right here."
f000581,1686.640,1689.440,"I put a mask on when I think I need it."
f000582,1689.440,1696.160,"Tonight, as an example, everybody’s had a test and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks-"
f000583,1696.160,1697.040,"Just like your rally."
f000584,1697.040,1697.400,"… when needed."
f000585,1697.400,1698.880,"When needed, I wear masks."
f000586,1698.880,1699.200,"Okay."
f000587,1699.200,1700.120,"Let me ask-"
f000588,1700.120,1701.520,"I don’t wear a mask like him."
f000589,1701.520,1703.040,"Every time you see him, he’s got a mask."
f000590,1703.040,1707.680,"He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen."
f000591,1707.680,1709.000,"I will say this-"
f000592,1709.000,1711.200,"Vice President Biden, go ahead, sir."
f000593,1711.200,1715.880,"Look, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able open."
f000594,1715.880,1718.080,"We provided money, the-"
f000595,1718.080,1719.720,"But I was asking you, sir, about masks."
f000596,1719.720,1721.720,"Well, masks make a big difference."
f000597,1721.720,1731.040,"His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we’d probably save up to 100,000 lives."
f000598,1731.040,1731.720,"It matters."
f000599,1731.720,1732.440,"It matters."
f000600,1732.440,1734.880,"And they’ve also said the opposite."
f000601,1734.880,1736.280,"They’ve also said-"
f000602,1736.280,1738.280,"No serious person has said the opposite."
f000603,1738.280,1739.600,"No serious person."
f000604,1739.600,1739.960,"Okay."
f000605,1739.960,1740.840,"I want to ask you-"
f000606,1740.840,1741.160,"Dr. Fauci."
f000607,1741.160,1742.000,"Dr. Fauci said the opposite."
f000608,1742.000,1743.560,"He did not say the opposite."
f000609,1743.560,1745.520,"I want to ask you, we’ve got a little than a minute left in this segment."
f000610,1745.520,1747.640,"He said very strongly, “Masks are not good.” Then he changed his mind."
f000611,1747.640,1748.240,"He said, “Masks are good.”"
f000612,1748.240,1748.680,"I want to ask-"
f000613,1748.680,1749.720,"I’m okay with masks."
f000614,1749.720,1750.720,"I’m not fighting masks."
f000615,1750.720,1756.680,"I want to ask you both about one last subject because your different approaches has even affected the way that you have campaigned."
f000616,1756.680,1761.520,"President Trump, you’re holding large rallies with crowds packed together, thousands of people."
f000617,1761.520,1762.160,"Outside."
f000618,1762.160,1763.280,"Outside."
f000619,1763.280,1763.680,"Yes, sir."
f000620,1763.680,1764.280,"Agreed."
f000621,1764.280,1769.280,"Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with-"
f000622,1769.280,1770.480,"Because nobody will show up."
f000623,1770.480,1771.480,"… people with masks."
f000624,1771.480,1772.760,"Well, it’s true."
f000625,1772.760,1774.080,"Nobody shows up to his rallies."
f000626,1774.080,1774.400,"All right."
f000627,1774.400,1777.120,"In any case, why you holding the big rallies?"
f000628,1777.120,1778.120,"Why you not?"
f000629,1778.120,1779.240,"You go first, sir."
f000630,1779.240,1782.320,"Because people want to hear what I have to say."
f000631,1782.320,1782.720,"I mean-"
f000632,1782.720,1784.200,"But are not worried about us spreading disease?"
f000633,1784.200,1788.560,"… I’m doing my job as a president, and I’ll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports."
f000634,1788.560,1790.800,"We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people-"
f000635,1790.800,1791.800,"Are you not worried about the disease issues, sir?"
f000636,1791.800,1795.000,"Well, so far we have had no problem whatsoever."
f000637,1795.000,1795.760,"It’s outside."
f000638,1795.760,1798.720,"That’s a big difference according to the experts."
f000639,1798.720,1806.320,"We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice."
f000640,1806.320,1809.440,"And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace."
f000641,1809.440,1813.520,"By the way, did you see one of the last big rallies he had?"
f000642,1813.520,1817.920,"A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, “No, no, no."
f000643,1817.920,1820.120,"Stand back, put on your mask, put on a mask."
f000644,1820.120,1821.320,"Have you been tested?"
f000645,1821.320,1829.360,"I’m way far away from those other people.” That’s what he said, “I’m going to be okay.” He’s not worried about you."
f000646,1829.360,1830.880,"He’s not worried about the people out there [crosstalk 00:08:48]."
f000647,1830.880,1832.960,"We’ve had no negative effect."
f000648,1832.960,1834.280,"No negative effect."
f000649,1834.280,1834.320,"Come on."
f000650,1834.320,1837.720,"We’ve had no negative effect, and we’ve had 35, 40,000 people at these rallies."
f000651,1837.720,1838.200,"All right."
f000652,1838.200,1839.760,"Do you want to just quickly finish up?"
f000653,1839.760,1840.880,"Because I want to move on to our next-"
f000654,1840.880,1841.640,"Yes, I would."
f000655,1841.640,1849.920,"He’s been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to."
f000656,1849.920,1851.200,"He’s a fool on this."
f000657,1851.200,1854.640,"If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing."
f000658,1854.640,1855.320,"But you can’t."
f000659,1855.320,1855.520,"Nobody cares."
f000660,1855.520,1856.600,"Gentlemen, can we move on to the-"
f000661,1856.600,1857.000,"No cares."
f000662,1857.000,1858.840,"Gentlemen, can we move on to the economy?"
f000663,1858.840,1859.240,"Yes."
f000664,1859.240,1865.320,"The economy is, I think it’s fair to say, recovering faster than expected from the shutdown-"
f000665,1865.320,1866.320,"Much faster."
f000666,1866.320,1867.240,"… in the second quarter."
f000667,1867.240,1870.640,"The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month."
f000668,1870.640,1879.200,"The Federal Reserve says the hit to growth, which is going to be there, is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected."
f000669,1879.200,1882.880,"President Trump, you say we are in a V-shaped recovery."
f000670,1882.880,1886.800,"Vice President Biden, you say it’s more of a K-shape."
f000671,1886.800,1892.680,"What difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy?"
f000672,1892.680,1895.000,"President Trump, in this segment you go first."
f000673,1895.000,1897.760,"So we built the greatest economy in history."
f000674,1897.760,1899.880,"We closed it down because of the China plague."
f000675,1899.880,1904.200,"When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do."
f000676,1904.200,1906.600,"He didn’t think we should close it down and he was wrong."
f000677,1906.600,1913.800,"Again, two million people would be dead now instead of… Still, 204,000 people is too much."
f000678,1913.800,1914.960,"One person is too much."
f000679,1914.960,1916.760,"Should have never happened from China."
f000680,1916.760,1922.040,"But what happened is we closed it down and now we’re reopening and we’re doing record business."
f000681,1922.040,1927.040,"We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we’ve put back into the workforce."
f000682,1927.040,1930.280,"That’s a record the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before."
f000683,1930.280,1933.240,"And he wants to close down the… He will shut it down again."
f000684,1933.240,1934.800,"He will destroy this country."
f000685,1934.800,1945.640,"A lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what’s happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns."
f000686,1945.640,1948.600,"And I’m telling you it’s because they don’t want to open it."
f000687,1948.600,1953.800,"One of them came out last week, you saw that, “Oh, we’re going to open up on November 9th.” Why November 9th?"
f000688,1953.800,1955.320,"Because it’s after the election."
f000689,1955.320,1958.400,"They think they’re hurting us by keeping them closed."
f000690,1958.400,1959.480,"They’re hurting people."
f000691,1959.480,1961.000,"People know what to do."
f000692,1961.000,1962.600,"They can social distance."
f000693,1962.600,1964.560,"They can wash their hands, they can wear masks."
f000694,1964.560,1967.560,"They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up."
f000695,1967.560,1976.840,"When you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up."
f000696,1976.840,1977.960,"It’s not fair."
f000697,1977.960,1980.160,"You’re talking about almost it’s like being in prison."
f000698,1980.160,1985.400,"And you look at what’s going on with divorce, look at what’s going on with alcoholism and drugs."
f000699,1985.400,1986.920,"It’s a very, very sad thing."
f000700,1986.920,1988.720,"And he’ll close down the whole country."
f000701,1988.720,1991.920,"This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country."
f000702,1991.920,1996.600,"Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it."
f000703,1996.600,1999.720,"We don’t need somebody to come in and say, “Let’s shut it down.”"
f000704,1999.720,2000.400,"All right."
f000705,2000.400,2001.720,"Your two minutes, sir."
f000706,2001.720,2002.680,"We’re now moved to you."
f000707,2002.680,2010.960,"As I said, posing the question, the president says it’s a V-shape recovery, you say it’s a K-shaped recovery."
f000708,2010.960,2012.040,"What’s the difference?"
f000709,2012.040,2018.080,"The difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the COVID crisis have done very well."
f000710,2018.080,2029.440,"Billionaires have made another $300 billion because of his profligate tax proposal, and he only focused on the market."
f000711,2029.440,2037.280,"But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in America, how well are you doing?"
f000712,2037.280,2040.400,"This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes."
f000713,2040.400,2040.960,"That’s wrong."
f000714,2040.960,2041.960,"Sir, wait."
f000715,2041.960,2042.560,"No."
f000716,2042.560,2042.920,"Sir-"
f000717,2042.920,2042.920,"[crosstalk 00:12:19]."
f000718,2042.920,2044.440,"Yeah, I understand."
f000719,2044.440,2046.680,"You’ve agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have it."
f000720,2046.680,2047.600,"Do I get my time back?"
f000721,2047.600,2059.760,"The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he’s going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president."
f000722,2059.760,2062.280,"Fewer jobs than when he became president."
f000723,2062.280,2063.680,"First one in American history."
f000724,2063.680,2069.680,"Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines."
f000725,2069.680,2074.040,"Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying."
f000726,2074.040,2079.120,"People who’ve been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it."
f000727,2079.120,2093.920,"And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more."
f000728,2093.920,2095.600,"Why is he want to open it up?"
f000729,2095.600,2101.320,"Why does he take care of the… You can’t fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis."
f000730,2101.320,2108.440,"And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety."
f000731,2108.440,2109.200,"Schools."
f000732,2109.200,2110.480,"Why aren’t schools open?"
f000733,2110.480,2113.480,"Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely."
f000734,2113.480,2122.640,"They were going to give, his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn’t do that because it’s not a national emergency."
f000735,2122.640,2124.240,"Not a national emergency."
f000736,2124.240,2127.120,"They’ve done nothing to help small businesses."
f000737,2127.120,2127.920,"Nothing."
f000738,2127.920,2128.800,"They’re closing."
f000739,2128.800,2130.760,"One in six is now gone."
f000740,2130.760,2137.240,"He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely."
f000741,2137.240,2137.600,"All right."
f000742,2137.600,2138.680,"Your time is up, sir."
f000743,2138.680,2139.520,"We are going to get to-"
f000744,2139.520,2140.880,"I have to respond to that."
f000745,2140.880,2142.360,"Well, you both had two minutes, sir."
f000746,2142.360,2144.320,"Excuse me, he made a statement."
f000747,2144.320,2145.200,"And so did you."
f000748,2145.200,2146.800,"No, people want their schools open."
f000749,2146.800,2148.120,"They don’t want to be shut down."
f000750,2148.120,2151.240,"They don’t want their state shut down."
f000751,2151.240,2152.120,"They want their restaurants."
f000752,2152.120,2152.960,"I look at New York."
f000753,2152.960,2154.840,"It’s so sad what’s happening in New York."
f000754,2154.840,2159.120,"It’s almost like a ghost town, and I’m not sure it can ever recover what they’ve done to New York."
f000755,2159.120,2160.320,"People want their places open."
f000756,2160.320,2161.320,"They want to get back to their lives."
f000757,2161.320,2162.480,"People want to be safe."
f000758,2162.480,2164.680,"They’ll be careful, but they want their schools open."
f000759,2164.680,2165.440,"People want to be safe."
f000760,2165.440,2167.920,"I’m the one that brought back football."
f000761,2167.920,2170.200,"By the way, I brought back Big Ten football."
f000762,2170.200,2172.960,"It was me and I’m very happy to do it-"
f000763,2172.960,2173.400,"All right."
f000764,2173.400,2173.960,"Let’s-"
f000765,2173.960,2176.680,"… and people of Ohio are very proud of me."
f000766,2176.680,2178.000,"And you know how I found out?"
f000767,2178.000,2178.200,"When [crosstalk 00:14:35]."
f000768,2178.200,2199.080,"Gentlemen, we’re going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment, but first, Mr. President, as you well know, there’s a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax each of those years."
f000769,2199.080,2205.000,"I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I’m asking you this specific question."
f000770,2205.000,2211.360,"Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes each of those two years?"
f000771,2211.360,2216.120,"I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax."
f000772,2216.120,2220.160,"And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid-"
f000773,2220.160,2221.440,"Show us your tax returns."
f000774,2221.440,2224.760,"I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year."
f000775,2224.760,2227.080,"Show us your tax returns."
f000776,2227.080,2229.760,"You’ll see it as soon as it’s finished, you’ll see it."
f000777,2229.760,2232.440,"You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections."
f000778,2232.440,2244.200,"There’s 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I’m totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company."
f000779,2244.200,2246.600,"Sir, I’m asking you a specific question, which is-"
f000780,2246.600,2247.320,"But let me tell you-"
f000781,2247.320,2248.400,"I understand all of that."
f000782,2248.400,2249.560,"Release your tax return."
f000783,2249.560,2250.720,"I understand all of that-"
f000784,2250.720,2250.880,"Let me-"
f000785,2250.880,2252.880,"No, Mr. President, I’m asking you a question."
f000786,2252.880,2260.040,"Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?"
f000787,2260.040,2261.320,"Millions of dollars."
f000788,2261.320,2261.800,"You paid millions of dollars in-"
f000789,2261.800,2262.840,"Millions of dollars, yes."
f000790,2262.840,2264.360,"So not 750?"
f000791,2264.360,2264.760,"Millions of dollars."
f000792,2264.760,2265.800,"And you’ll get to see it."
f000793,2265.800,2266.600,"And you’ll get to see it."
f000794,2266.600,2267.040,"When?"
f000795,2267.040,2268.320,"But let me just tell you-"
f000796,2268.320,2268.480,"In [crosstalk 00:16:04]?"
f000797,2268.480,2272.200,"Chris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws."
f000798,2272.200,2273.520,"I don’t want to pay tax."
f000799,2273.520,2278.120,"Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people."
f000800,2278.120,2283.880,"Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is."
f000801,2283.880,2291.200,"He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits."
f000802,2291.200,2296.000,"We build the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue."
f000803,2296.000,2301.080,"Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama administration, if you can believe that."
f000804,2301.080,2305.240,"Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that’s-"
f000805,2305.240,2308.800,"Vice President Biden, you want to respond?"
f000806,2308.800,2312.000,"Yeah, I do want to respond."
f000807,2312.000,2322.960,"Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him… He says he’s smart because he can take advantage of the tax code."
f000808,2322.960,2325.080,"And he does take advantage of the tax code."
f000809,2325.080,2327.720,"That’s why I’m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts."
f000810,2327.720,2330.320,"And I’m going to eliminate those tax cuts."
f000811,2330.320,2330.960,"That’s okay."
f000812,2330.960,2334.520,"And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help."
f000813,2334.520,2336.720,"People out there need help."
f000814,2336.720,2339.280,"But why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?"
f000815,2339.280,2340.560,"Because you weren’t president-"
f000816,2340.560,2341.160,"Why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?"
f000817,2341.160,2343.240,"Because you weren’t president and screwing things up."

f000819,2344.920,2347.680,"You’re the worst president America has ever had."
f000820,2347.680,2348.000,"Come on."
f000821,2348.000,2350.080,"Hey, Joe, let me just tell you, Joe."
f000822,2350.080,2354.800,"In 47 months, I’ve done more than you’ve done in 47 years, Joe."
f000823,2354.800,2357.040,"We’ve done things that you never even thought of doing."
f000824,2357.040,2357.440,"Okay."
f000825,2357.440,2357.840,"Gentlemen?"
f000826,2357.840,2361.920,"Including fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts."
f000827,2361.920,2363.840,"Mr. President, we’re talking about the economy."
f000828,2363.840,2369.280,"I’d like to ask you about your plans going forward because Mr. Vice President, your economic plan-"
f000829,2369.280,2369.760,"He has none."
f000830,2369.760,2375.960,"… if you were to be elected president focuses a lot on big government, big taxes, big spending."
f000831,2375.960,2378.200,"I want to focus first on the taxes."
f000832,2378.200,2384.640,"You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year."
f000833,2384.640,2388.880,"… on individuals making more than $400,000 a year and on corporations."
f000834,2388.880,2396.760,"President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it’s just coming out of a recession."
f000835,2396.760,2409.160,"Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one."
f000836,2409.160,2417.400,"And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American."
f000837,2417.400,2426.360,"The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like."
f000838,2426.360,2432.560,"And under my proposal, we’re going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company-"
f000839,2432.560,2436.160,"But respectfully, sir, I’m talking about taxes, not spending."
f000840,2436.160,2440.080,"By the way, I’m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes."
f000841,2440.080,2442.760,"I’m going to make the corporate tax 28%."
f000842,2442.760,2444.120,"It shouldn’t be 21%."
f000843,2444.120,2452.720,"You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don’t pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars."
f000844,2452.720,2455.960,"Why didn’t you do it before, when you were vice president with Obama?"
f000845,2455.960,2459.760,"Because you in fact passed that, that was your tax proposal."
f000846,2459.760,2460.280,"I got it done."
f000847,2460.280,2461.280,"And you know what happened?"
f000848,2461.280,2462.360,"Yeah, you got it done-"
f000849,2462.360,2463.840,"Our economy boomed like it’s never boomed before."
f000850,2463.840,2464.400,"The economy-"
f000851,2464.400,2465.680,"Mr. President-"
f000852,2465.680,2466.320,"Let me finish."
f000853,2466.320,2468.040,"Mr. President, let me pick up on that."
f000854,2468.040,2474.400,"You would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct?"
f000855,2474.400,2475.840,"Not lower tax for the American people."
f000856,2475.840,2476.880,"But let me-"
f000857,2476.880,2477.360,"Excuse me."
f000858,2477.360,2480.160,"You talk about the economy booming."
f000859,2480.160,2490.760,"It turns out that in Obama’s final three years as president more jobs were created, a million and a half more jobs, than in the first three years of your presidency."
f000860,2490.760,2496.880,"They had the slowest economic recovery since 1929."
f000861,2496.880,2498.960,"It was the slowest recovery."
f000862,2498.960,2501.840,"Also, they took over something that was down here."
f000863,2501.840,2504.280,"All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot."
f000864,2504.280,2509.320,"But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market."
f000865,2509.320,2511.960,"When the stock market goes up, that means jobs."
f000866,2511.960,2513.760,"It also means 401ks."
f000867,2513.760,2519.680,"If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes."
f000868,2519.680,2521.200,"I’ll tell you what, you’ll lose."
f000869,2521.200,2523.480,"Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave."
f000870,2523.480,2527.840,"And plenty of companies that are already here, they’ll leave for other places."
f000871,2527.840,2532.520,"[crosstalk 00:20:25] They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen."
f000872,2532.520,2532.920,"Look-"
f000873,2532.920,2534.400,"Mr. Vice President."
f000874,2534.400,2538.360,"… we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history."
f000875,2538.360,2540.200,"I was asked to bring it back."
f000876,2540.200,2544.480,"We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you’re talking about."
f000877,2544.480,2547.680,"We handed him a booming economy, he blew it."
f000878,2547.680,2548.720,"It wasn’t blooming."
f000879,2548.720,2549.320,"He blew it."
f000880,2549.320,2550.480,"He was in booming."
f000881,2550.480,2553.480,"It was the weakest recovery since 1929."
f000882,2553.480,2556.120,"Wait, wait, is it fair to say he blew it when, in fact-"
f000883,2556.120,2557.520,"When COVID came along."
f000884,2557.520,2560.720,"… when there was record low unemployment before COVID."
f000885,2560.720,2565.240,"Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole."
f000886,2565.240,2567.520,"Manufacturing went in a hole-"
f000887,2567.520,2568.480,"Excuse me, Chris, wait."
f000888,2568.480,2568.880,"… number one."

f000897,2576.280,2578.480,"… a miracle to bring back manufacturing."
f000898,2578.480,2580.720,"I brought back 700,000 jobs."
f000899,2580.720,2581.960,"They brought back nothing."
f000900,2581.960,2583.600,"They gave up on manufacturing."
f000901,2583.600,2584.200,"We did not."

f000903,2584.200,2585.080,"… standard fare."

f000905,2587.880,2588.560,"He totally gave up on manufacturing."
f000906,2588.560,2589.160,"All right, let him-"

f000909,2594.280,2595.200,"He blew it."
f000910,2595.200,2595.880,"They’re gone."
f000911,2595.880,2596.640,"He blew it."

f000915,2603.440,2604.320,"That is not true."
f000916,2604.320,2610.480,"Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn’t come in with you."

f000920,2614.200,2616.240,"He’s done very little."

f001029,2790.520,2791.240,"Vice President-"
f001030,2791.240,2792.400,"Chris, can I be honest?"
f001031,2792.400,2794.360,"It’s a very important question-"
f001032,2794.360,2797.120,"Try to be honest."
f001033,2797.120,2797.400,"No."
f001034,2797.400,2797.920,"He stood up-"
f001035,2797.920,2799.160,"The answer to the question is no."
f001036,2799.160,2801.040,"… and the threatened Ukraine-"
f001037,2801.040,2801.680,"Sir-"
f001038,2801.680,2803.160,"… with a billion dollars-"
f001039,2803.160,2805.080,"That is absolutely not true."
f001040,2805.080,2805.800,"Stop."
f001041,2805.800,2811.120,"[crosstalk 00:25:02] Gentlemen, I hate to raise my voice, but I- [crosstalk 00:25:05] Why should I be different than the two of you?"
f001042,2811.120,2812.480,"So here’s the deal."
f001043,2812.480,2813.640,"That’s a good point."
f001044,2813.640,2815.960,"We have six segments."
f001045,2815.960,2817.200,"We have ended that segment."
f001046,2817.200,2818.880,"We’re going to go to the next segment."
f001047,2818.880,2822.400,"In that segment, you each are going to have two uninterrupted moments."
f001048,2822.400,2825.920,"In those two interrupted minutes, Mr. President, you can say anything you want."
f001049,2825.920,2830.360,"I’m going to ask a question about race, but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead."
f001050,2830.360,2838.320,"But I think that the country would be better served, if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions."
f001051,2838.320,2839.960,"I’m appealing to you, sir, to do that."
f001052,2839.960,2841.040,"Well, and him too."
f001053,2841.040,2844.560,"Well, frankly, you’ve been doing more interrupting than he has."
f001054,2844.560,2847.120,"Well, that’s all right, but he does plenty."
f001055,2847.120,2848.240,"Well, sir, less than-"
f001056,2848.240,2849.080,"He does plenty."
f001057,2849.080,2849.640,"No, less than you have."
f001058,2849.640,2851.120,"Let’s please continue on."
