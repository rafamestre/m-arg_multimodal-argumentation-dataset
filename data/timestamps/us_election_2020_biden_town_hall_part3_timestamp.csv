f000001,0.000,1.880,"And the Supreme Court is our next topic."
f000002,1.880,6.320,"The questioner, Nathan Osburn of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Democrat."
f000003,6.320,8.280,"Hi, I’m George and Mr. Vice President."
f000004,8.280,9.400,"Hey, Nathan."
f000005,9.400,18.000,"Our country’s first Supreme Court gave its first ruling is just two blocks from here from 1791 to 1800, and it’s become more polarized since then."
f000006,18.000,26.240,"Merrick Garland didn’t get a hearing for all of 2016 and Amy Coney Barrett is being pushed through at the last minute, even though millions have already voted."
f000007,26.240,35.080,"So what do you think about ideas from people like Pete Buttigieg and others to put in place safeguards that will help ensure more long-term balance and stability?"
f000008,35.080,43.800,"And what do you say to LGBTQ Americans and others who are very worried right now about erosions of their rights and our democracy as a whole?"
f000009,43.800,49.440,"Well, let me start at the last point and work my way back."
f000010,49.440,51.760,"I think there’s great reason to be concerned."
f000011,51.760,56.120,"I was on the road most of the time during these hearings so I didn’t hear many of them."
f000012,56.120,60.440,"I just got the recaps when I’d get in late at night."
f000013,60.440,72.040,"I’m been going around the country, Florida, anyway, but my reading online what the judge said was she didn’t answer very many questions at all."
f000014,72.040,82.240,"And I don’t even think she is laid out much of a judicial philosophy in terms of the basis upon which she thinks are there unenumerated rights in the Constitution, nonetheless."
f000015,82.240,83.520,"So, number one."
f000016,83.520,92.960,"So I think there’s great reason to be concerned for the LGBT community, something I fought very hard for, for a long time to make sure there’s equality across the board."
f000017,92.960,117.440,"Number two, I think that also healthcare overall is very much in jeopardy as a consequence of the President’s going to go directly after this election directly to the Supreme Court within a month to try to get Obamacare wiped out after 10 million people have already lost her insurance from their employer and wants to take 20 million people out of the system as well, plus 100 million people with pre-existing conditions."
f000018,117.440,119.640,"So there’s a lot at stake."
f000019,119.640,121.560,"I don’t think it’s appropriate."
f000020,121.560,140.600,"I think the Constitution implies, there’s no provision in the Constitution, my problem is I made a mistake of teaching constitutional law for 21 years, and the separation of powers, the Constitution implies that their way the people have a right to determine who’s going to be on the court is how they vote for their Senators and their President."
f000021,140.600,143.000,"We seek the advice and consent of the Senate."
f000022,143.000,143.360,"And the President-"
f000023,143.360,146.240,"The President is President for all four years, isn’t he?"
f000024,146.240,146.640,"He is."
f000025,146.640,154.560,"But once an election begins, by implication, it is inconsistent with the constitutional principles, in my view."
f000026,154.560,162.400,"You get disagreement among scholars on this, but I believe it’s inconsistent when millions of people have already voted to put someone on the Court."
f000027,162.400,169.800,"I think it should have been held until this election is over, see what the makeup of the Senate is going to be."
f000028,169.800,172.800,"If the President wins this election, he should be able to go for it."
f000029,172.800,174.560,"But how about that question of expanding the court?"
f000030,174.560,177.520,"Here’s what you said exactly one year ago tonight at a Democratic debate."
f000031,177.520,180.000,"You said, “I would not get into court packing."
f000032,180.000,183.000,"I would not pack the court.” That’s not what you’re saying now."
f000033,183.000,187.440,"Is the nomination of Judge Barrett reason enough to rethink your position?"
f000034,187.440,198.200,"What I wanted to do, George, you know if I had answered the question directly then all the focus would be on, what’s Biden going to do if he wins?"
f000035,198.200,202.040,"Instead of on, is it appropriate what is going on now?"
f000036,202.040,203.440,"And it should stay."
f000037,203.440,209.240,"This is the thing that the President loves to do, always take our eye off the ball what’s at stake."
f000038,209.240,225.320,"One of the things Pete has suggested is, and there’s a number of constitutional scholars have suggested as well, that there are at least four or five options that are available to determine whether or not you can change the way in which the court lifetime appointment takes place consistent arguably with the Constitution."
f000039,225.320,230.280,"I have not been a fan of court packing because then it just generates what will happen."
f000040,230.280,236.760,"Whoever wins, it just keeps moving in a way that is inconsistent with what is going to be manageable."
f000041,236.760,238.000,"So you’re still not a fan?"
f000042,238.000,239.440,"Well, I’m not a fan."
f000043,239.440,241.640,"It depends on how this turns out."
f000044,241.640,245.360,"Not how he wins, but how it’s handled, how it’s handled."
f000045,245.360,251.200,"But there’s a number of things that are going to be coming up and there’s going to be a lot of discussion about other alternative as well."
f000046,251.200,252.880,"What does that mean, how it’s handled?"
f000047,252.880,254.240,"How will that determine [crosstalk 00:23:42]."
f000048,254.240,262.840,"For example, there’s actually real live debate on the floor, if people are really going to be able to have a time to go through this."
f000049,262.840,268.920,"I don’t know anybody who’s gone on the floor that’s been a controversial justice in terms of making fundamentally or altering the makeup of the court that’s gone through in a day kind of thing."
f000050,268.920,270.440,"I mean, it depends on …"
f000051,270.440,274.320,"… and the makeup of the court has gone through in a day kind of thing."
f000052,274.320,277.280,"I mean, it depends on how much they rushed this."
f000053,277.280,294.240,"And you think about it, George, here you got a lot of people not to be able to pay their mortgage, not being able to put food on the table, not being able to keep their business open, not being able to do anything to deal with what’s going on in terms of the economy as a consequence of COVID and they have no time to deal with that, but they have time to rush this through."
f000054,294.240,296.320,"Well, right now it looks like they’re going to have a vote around Halloween."
f000055,296.320,299.240,"So if they vote on it, [crosstalk 00:48:26] for the election."
f000056,299.240,303.200,"If they vote on it before the election, you are open to expanding the court?"
f000057,303.200,307.560,"I’m open to considering what happens from that point on."
f000058,307.560,312.920,"You know, you said so many times during the campaign, all through the course of your career, it’s important to level with [crosstalk 00:48:41]"
f000059,312.920,313.480,"It is."
f000060,313.480,314.320,"Good choice."
f000061,314.320,318.560,"No matter what answer I gave you, if I say it, that’s the headline tomorrow."
f000062,318.560,322.400,"It won’t be about what’s going on now, the improper way they’re proceeding."
f000063,322.400,324.400,"But don’t voters have a right to know where you stand?"
f000064,324.400,328.960,"They do have a right to know what I stand and they’ll have a right to know where I stand before they vote."
f000065,328.960,331.120,"So you’ll come out with a clear position before election day?"
f000066,331.120,331.960,"Yes."
f000067,331.960,333.680,"Depending on how they handle this."
f000068,333.680,348.160,"But look, what you should do is you got to make sure you vote and vote for a senator who in fact reflects your general view on constitutional interpretation, and vote for a president who thinks is more in line with you."
f000069,348.160,367.600,"And if you oppose the position that I would not have appointed her, but if you oppose my position, vote for Trump, vote for Republican who shares that view, but that’s your opportunity to get involved in lifetime appointments that have presidents come and go, justices stay and stay and stay."
f000070,367.600,370.040,"You have a question from a Republican, Andrew Lewis."
f000071,370.040,372.600,"I would guess a disaffected Republican."
f000072,372.600,375.720,"You cast a write-in vote for John Kasich in 2016."
f000073,375.720,377.880,"You’re going to vote against President Trump this year."
f000074,377.880,379.960,"John’s writing in for me, by the way."
f000075,379.960,381.040,"I know that."
f000076,381.040,382.080,"I’m sorry."
f000077,382.080,389.400,"Mr. Vice President, my father Drew Lewis served as secretary of transportation under President Ronald Reagan in his first time."
f000078,389.400,390.840,"Oh yeah, I’ll be darned."
f000079,390.840,396.760,"And some of his closest allies and friends were Democrats, including House Speaker Tip O’Neill and Senator Ted Kennedy."
f000080,396.760,401.560,"Sadly, today we have highly partisan and dysfunctional governance."
f000081,401.560,407.520,"And I believe President Trump is primarily responsible for creating this toxic environment."
f000082,407.520,420.480,"As president, how will you avoid the temptation to exact revenge and instead take the high road and attempt to restore bipartisanship, civility, and honor to our democracy?"
f000083,420.480,427.400,"It was written by a fellow who won the Pulitzer prize for a book he wrote about the presidency."
f000084,427.400,430.680,"He said I doubt whether Biden is really Irish."
f000085,430.680,433.280,"He doesn’t hold a grudge."
f000086,433.280,435.440,"In politics, grudges don’t work."
f000087,435.440,436.440,"They make no sense."
f000088,436.440,437.240,"I really mean it."
f000089,437.240,447.720,"I have never, and the second point I’d make is everybody talks about, “Yeah, Joe, when you were a senator and a chairman of foreign relations or chairman of judiciary, you got a lot of things done."
f000090,447.720,450.200,"You’re able to cross the aisle but the days are changed."
f000091,450.200,454.360,"When you’re vice president, you got a lot done, but it can’t happen anymore.” It can."
f000092,454.360,457.320,"We got to change the nature of the way we deal with one another."
f000093,457.320,461.920,"And it starts off by the way your father was and Tip was and others."
f000094,461.920,464.240,"You don’t question another man or woman’s motive."
f000095,464.240,468.320,"You can question their judgment, but not their motive."
f000096,468.320,470.560,"We badly needed an infrastructure bill."
f000097,470.560,471.800,"Well, what happens?"
f000098,471.800,480.880,"I stand up and I say, “We need an infrastructure bill, Senator, but I tell you what, you’re in the pocket of the cement industry, but let’s see what we can do.” He can’t get anywhere."
f000099,480.880,482.480,"Nothing happens."
f000100,482.480,483.520,"Nothing happens."
f000101,483.520,484.960,"I learned that lesson a long time ago."
f000102,484.960,492.720,"I’ve never, even when it’s obvious on its face what the motive is, stick to the subject and listen to the other guy."
f000103,492.720,497.240,"Listen, what I will be doing as, if I’m elected president and the first thing and not a joke."
f000104,497.240,504.400,"And you can ask if they’d tell you, your dad’s old friends in the Republican side, I’m going to pick up the phone and call them and say, “Let’s get together."
f000105,504.400,506.480,"We’ve got to figure out how we’re going to move forward here.”"
f000106,506.480,510.000,"Because there’s so many things we really do agree on."
f000107,510.000,519.720,"And with Trump out of the way, the vindictiveness of a president going after Republicans who don’t do exactly what he says gets taken away."
f000108,519.720,528.400,"There’s going to be, I promise you, between four and eight Republican senators who are going to be willing to move on things where there’s bipartisan consensus."
f000109,528.400,530.040,"Last example I’ll give you."
f000110,530.040,544.200,"After Trump had been elected, named the next president, wasn’t sworn in yet, I’ve been working on a thing called a bill relating to cancer cures."
f000111,544.200,545.160,"Okay?"
f000112,545.160,546.840,"And it was called the Cancer Moonshot."
f000113,546.840,549.280,"And I work with a number of Democrats and Republicans."
f000114,549.280,560.480,"And we had a bill that was about $9 billion that made significant increases in research and development on cancer alternatives, NIH and particularly specific cancer initiatives."
f000115,560.480,568.800,"And we only had at the time I think it was 111 or 114, whatever it was, votes in the house."
f000116,568.800,570.040,"I don’t hold any exact number."
f000117,570.040,585.040,"And we had fewer than 40 in the Senate, but after he was elected, I got those people together as vice president and we sat down and we worked it out and we ended up getting a pass 396 votes in the house and 94 votes in the Senate."
f000118,585.040,592.360,"And at the end of the day, because it had to do with the Biden Cancer Moonshot I’ve been working on, Mitch McConnell."
f000119,592.360,600.880,"Mitch McConnell stood up and I was presiding officer and moved to name the bill after my deceased son, Beau, who had just died."
f000120,600.880,603.080,"So, there are ways to bring this together."
f000121,603.080,606.520,"But how about the question of political accountability?"
f000122,606.520,609.760,"Is there some tension between that and bringing people together?"
f000123,609.760,615.600,"Robert Mueller laid out a lot of evidence of possible obstruction of justice by President Trump."
f000124,615.600,619.200,"What would a Biden Justice Department do with that evidence?"
f000125,619.200,625.880,"What the Biden Justice Department will do is let the Department of Justice be the Department of Justice."
f000126,625.880,629.720,"Let them make the judgments of who should be prosecuted."
f000127,629.720,631.400,"They’re not my lawyers."
f000128,631.400,632.680,"They’re not my personal lawyer."
f000129,632.680,634.560,"So, you’re not going to rule it in or rule it out?"
f000130,634.560,635.720,"I’m not going to rule in or out."
f000131,635.720,653.320,"Well, I’m going to hire really first rate prosecutors and people who understand the law like Democrat and Republican administrations have had, and let them make the judgements, but turning this into a vehicle for your, as if it’s your own law firm, you don’t own that justice department."
f000132,653.320,659.720,"You pick the best people you can and you hope that what they’re going to do is they’re going to enforce the law as they see it."
f000133,659.720,664.120,"But can you remember any Republican president going out there or former Democratic president go find that guy and prosecute him?"
f000134,664.120,664.440,"Remember, where you hear that?"
f000135,664.440,666.880,"Or by the way, I’m being sued because a woman has accused me of rape."
f000136,666.880,667.520,"Represent me."
f000137,667.520,668.240,"Represent me."
f000138,668.240,670.600,"Personally represent me in the state of New York on my not allowing my tax returns."
f000139,670.600,671.080,"What’s that all about?"
f000140,671.080,671.800,"What is that about?"
f000141,671.800,673.280,"Got to take another break."
f000142,673.280,674.040,"We’ll be right back."
f000143,674.040,677.840,"The executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America."
f000144,677.840,683.680,"He shall hold his office during the term of four years and together with the vice president chosen for the- From the constitution center in Philadelphia, here again, George Stephanopoulos."
