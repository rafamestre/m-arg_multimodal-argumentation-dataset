f000001,0.000,1.400,"And we’re back."
f000002,1.400,4.720,"We’re live in Miami with President Trump for a town hall."
f000003,4.720,7.000,"Live in Miami with President Trump for a town hall."
f000004,7.000,8.320,"Thank you again, Mr. President."
f000005,8.320,9.240,"We have another voter."
f000006,9.240,14.440,"Now, Christie Alonzo, come on out, Christie, she is leaning slightly towards you, she says."
f000007,14.440,16.720,"She voted for you in 2016."
f000008,16.720,17.560,"Christie, you ready?"
f000009,17.560,20.720,"Take the mask off, hold the mic close, and let’s hear your question."
f000010,20.720,22.360,"Thank you for your service, Mr. President."
f000011,22.360,23.120,"Thank you."
f000012,23.120,23.680,"Thank you very much."
f000013,23.680,26.400,"We’re a hard-working middle-class family of four."
f000014,26.400,31.680,"My husband and I are both self-employed, and we have to get our own individual healthcare."
f000015,31.680,36.120,"As you know, healthcare costs have gone up considerably over the decades."
f000016,36.120,40.400,"And you had originally said you were going to repeal and replace Obamacare."
f000017,40.400,46.760,"What is your plan now in 2020 to make healthcare costs affordable for Americans like myself?"
f000018,46.760,47.160,"Good."
f000019,47.160,61.040,"So we got rid of the individual mandate on Obamacare, which was the worst part of Obamacare, and now you could actually say it’s not Obamacare because that’s how big it was, where you had to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance, so we got rid of that."
f000020,61.040,63.280,"That was a big, big thing."
f000021,63.280,75.360,"And by doing that, and we will always have… By the way, we’re always protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and I can’t say that more strongly, but we’ve been able to bring healthcare costs way down."
f000022,75.360,81.160,"Now, I took over Obamacare, got rid of the individual mandate, made it good, managed it much better."
f000023,81.160,87.720,"Remember, they had the $5 billion website disaster, and all of the problems they had."
f000024,87.720,90.160,"The problem with Obamacare, it’s not good."
f000025,90.160,98.400,"We’d like to terminate it, and we want a much less expensive healthcare that’s a much better healthcare, and that’s where we’re aiming."
f000026,98.400,105.240,"And if we can do that, and we have a very good chance of doing it, but we’ve also brought down the price of Obamacare."
f000027,105.240,111.440,"The problem with Obamacare, it basically is never going to be great, and I want to give great healthcare."
f000028,111.440,111.520,"So important."
f000029,111.520,112.840,"And thank you very much."
f000030,112.840,114.520,"Mr. President, I got a follow-up pre-existing conditions."
f000031,114.520,116.160,"This is such a big issue for voters."
f000032,116.160,117.640,"It is a big issue for me too."
f000033,117.640,125.720,"In point of fact, your administration is about to go to the Supreme Court to argue to throw out the rest of Obamacare, which includes the protections for preexisting conditions."
f000034,125.720,126.360,"That’s right."
f000035,126.360,127.040,"That’s right."
f000036,127.040,130.960,"So your administration is in court right now, trying to get rid of that protection."
f000037,130.960,136.600,"In order to replace it with a much better healthcare at a much lower price."
f000038,136.600,142.280,"And always, under all circumstances, we are going to protect the Republicans."
f000039,142.280,148.880,"And maybe I changed the party a lot over the last three years, but we will protect people with preexisting conditions."
f000040,148.880,152.800,"And Savannah, what I want to do, get rid of the terrible Obamacare."
f000041,152.800,157.640,"I’ve already done it to a large extent because as you know, the individual mandate is gone."
f000042,157.640,158.840,"That was the worst part."
f000043,158.840,160.320,"You repealed, but you haven’t replaced."
f000044,160.320,161.360,"No, no."
f000045,161.360,163.280,"Now, you’ve been in office almost four years."
f000046,163.280,163.880,"We have done-"
f000047,163.880,169.560,"You have both houses of Congress, Senate and House, in Republican hands, and there is not a replacement yet."
f000048,169.560,170.480,"That’s right."
f000049,170.480,173.040,"I’m sorry, but if you look, we had both houses and what did we do?"
f000050,173.040,173.880,"We got rid of the individual mandate."
f000051,173.880,175.280,"That went through the legislature."
f000052,175.280,177.440,"But the promise was repeal and replace."
f000053,177.440,178.320,"Look, look."
f000054,178.320,180.080,"We should be on the same side."
f000055,180.080,181.120,"I wanted very simple."
f000056,181.120,182.400,"I’m going to put it very simple."
f000057,182.400,188.560,"We would like to terminate it, and we would like to replace it with something that’s much less expensive and much better."
f000058,188.560,191.840,"We will always protect people with preexisting conditions."
f000059,191.840,193.000,"But if you’re successful in court-"
f000060,193.000,193.200,"And here’s the thing-"
f000061,193.200,196.880,"… in November, those preexisting conditions, that promise will be gone."
f000062,196.880,202.440,"If we don’t succeed, we are running the remnants of whatever’s left because we took it apart."
f000063,202.440,213.480,"We are running the remnants of whatever’s left much better than the previous administration, which ran it very badly, but we’d like to have new healthcare much better and much less expensive."
f000064,213.480,215.160,"Let me get to question number five."
f000065,215.160,217.200,"And you’ll like this, he’s stuck in traffic."
f000066,217.200,218.840,"His name is Joe White."
f000067,218.840,220.760,"He is registered as a Democrat."
f000068,220.760,225.720,"He says he’s leaning toward Biden and voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016."
f000069,225.720,232.960,"And his question was a, a second stimulus payment has been broadly agreed upon by the Republicans and Democrats, and yet, now we’re in October and it’s still not passed."
f000070,232.960,239.880,"Why not use your office to make the second stimulus payment a separate targeted emergency relief package to help Americans weather the pandemic?"
f000071,239.880,245.800,"Well, we’ve actually passed three packages, and we’re on our fourth, and I agree with him 100%."
f000072,245.800,246.800,"He should vote for me."
f000073,246.800,248.720,"The problem you have is Nancy Pelosi."
f000074,248.720,250.600,"She couldn’t care less about the worker."
f000075,250.600,253.400,"She couldn’t care less about our people."
f000076,253.400,256.200,"And we should have a stimulus, and I want a stimulus."
f000077,256.200,258.160,"The Republicans will approve a stimulus."
f000078,258.160,262.600,"The problem is she doesn’t want to do it because she thinks it’s bad for her election."
f000079,262.600,273.200,"The fact is, she’s wrong because people know she’s in our way, she’s not approving it, she doesn’t appreciate our people, and she doesn’t appreciate, at all, our workers."
f000080,273.200,278.360,"Nancy Pelosi, we are ready to sign and pass stimulus, but she’s got to approve it."
f000081,278.360,283.320,"People do not love the back and forth of Washington, but this has been a rollercoaster."
f000082,283.320,290.040,"Back in early October, you one day tweeted, “No more negotiations until after election day."
f000083,290.040,294.720,"I’m walking away.” Then, I think the next couple of days you said, “Maybe we can do something targeted.”"
f000084,294.720,295.200,"That’s right."
f000085,295.200,302.880,"Then you said, “I want a big, big bill.” But then Senate Republicans said, “No, we’re not for that.” So you are the big deal-maker."
f000086,302.880,306.160,"How come this is so… You yourself had changed positions."
f000087,306.160,306.680,"That’s right."
f000088,306.680,311.000,"Did you ever hear a word called negotiation when negotiating?"
f000089,311.000,311.680,"Okay."
f000090,311.680,312.360,"I’m negotiating-"
f000091,312.360,315.040,"But people’s lives are hanging in the balance."
f000092,315.040,315.760,"You know what?"
f000093,315.760,316.840,"And you know who I’m negotiating against?"
f000094,316.840,319.400,"Nancy Pelosi, because she doesn’t want to give them money."
f000095,319.400,320.840,"We should have stimulus."
f000096,320.840,322.480,"This was not our people’s fault."
f000097,322.480,324.240,"This was China’s fault."
f000098,324.240,325.720,"And she’s penalizing our people."
f000099,325.720,328.440,"I’m ready to sign a big, beautiful stimulus."
f000100,328.440,331.280,"You saw the other day, I said, “Go big or go home.” Right?"
f000101,331.280,333.040,"That’s what I was talking about."
f000102,333.040,333.560,"I want it to be big."
f000103,333.560,334.400,"I want it to be bold."
f000104,334.400,336.520,"I want the money to go to directly to the people."
f000105,336.520,337.960,"Senate Republicans with you, they’re going to go big?"
f000106,337.960,338.120,"They’ll go."
f000107,338.120,338.720,"Yeah, they’ll go."
f000108,338.720,338.960,"They’ll go."
f000109,338.960,339.240,"They’re going be very active-"
f000110,339.240,341.280,"Okay, because so far, they have not said they would."
f000111,341.280,344.600,"I know, because I haven’t asked them to because I can’t get through Nancy Pelosi."
f000112,344.600,345.120,"Okay."
f000113,345.120,353.240,"If Nancy Pelosi and I, through my representatives or directly, I don’t care, if we agree to something, the Republicans will agree to it."
f000114,353.240,353.760,"Okay."
f000115,353.760,357.160,"Our next question comes from… Oh, this is interesting."
f000116,357.160,362.840,"She voted for Clinton in 2016, but recently changed her registration from Democrat to Independent."
f000117,362.840,364.440,"She says she’s truly undecided."
f000118,364.440,365.880,"Her name’s Becky Lightman."
f000119,365.880,366.960,"Hello, Becky."
f000120,366.960,368.000,"What’s your question?"
f000121,368.000,368.600,"How are you?"
f000122,368.600,369.320,"Hi, I’m great."
f000123,369.320,369.600,"How are you?"
f000124,369.600,371.240,"Nice to see you."
f000125,371.240,372.400,"Thank you."
f000126,372.400,372.400,"Good to see you."
f000127,372.400,377.840,"So corporate tax rates are a hot button issue and you have cut corporate tax rates."
f000128,377.840,381.040,"And your opponent, Joe Biden, is planning to raise them."
f000129,381.040,388.200,"A lot of Americans think that corporations don’t pay their share of taxes and want to see those tax rates increase."
f000130,388.200,396.760,"What do you say to those Americans to maybe tell them why you want the corporate tax rate lower and why that helps them?"
f000131,396.760,397.680,"It’s a great question."
f000132,397.680,401.000,"We’ve created more jobs than this country has ever created."
f000133,401.000,403.520,"We were up to 160 million jobs."
f000134,403.520,404.880,"We were never even close to that number."
f000135,404.880,421.360,"We were just hitting 160 million jobs, companies are pouring into our nation because of the tax rate, and if Biden comes in and raises taxes on everybody, including middle income taxes, which he wants to do, you will blow this thing, and you’ll end up with a depression, the likes of which you’ve never had."
f000136,421.360,422.840,"That’s what’s going to happen."
f000137,422.840,424.480,"We have something that’s really good."
f000138,424.480,428.640,"The reason we’re coming back so strong is because we built a very strong foundation."
f000139,428.640,430.040,"Companies are moving in."
f000140,430.040,440.160,"Car companies are moving into Michigan, into Ohio, into South Carolina, and North Carolina just today, so what’s happening is, they’re coming in because we reduced the taxes."
f000141,440.160,445.560,"Our taxes, our corporate taxes were the highest in the world, and now they’re among the lower taxes."
f000142,445.560,449.000,"They’re not the lowest, but they’re among the lowest."
f000143,449.000,456.840,"And what that means, is jobs, but also we’re doing a very big, and we’ve done a very big, middle income tax package."
f000144,456.840,460.800,"So if we get in, we’re going to do the middle income tax package, but it’s a great question."
f000145,460.800,468.680,"And if he comes along and raises rates, all those companies that are coming in, they will leave the U.S. so fast your head will spin."
f000146,468.680,469.960,"We can’t let that happen."
f000147,469.960,470.320,"Thank you."
f000148,470.320,485.920,"On the subject of taxes, as you know, the New York times has obtained, it says years of your tax returns among other things, it says that you have debts of approximately $421 million that you have personally guaranteed, and that will come due in the next four years."
f000149,485.920,489.600,"The question is, on behalf of voters, who do you owe $421 million to?"
f000150,489.600,491.360,"Okay, first of all, let me answer."
f000151,491.360,493.320,"What they did is illegal, number one."
f000152,493.320,496.640,"Also, the numbers are all wrong, with the numbers they released."
f000153,496.640,501.680,"And just so you understand, when you have a lot of real estate, I have real estate, you know a lot of it."
f000154,501.680,502.400,"Okay?"
f000155,502.400,506.520,"Right down the road, Doral, big stuff, great stuff."
f000156,506.520,513.040,"When I decided to run, I’m very underlevered, fortunately, but I’m very underlevered."
f000157,513.040,516.520,"I have a very, very small percentage of debt compared."
f000158,516.520,520.480,"In fact, some of it, I did as favors to institutions that wanted to loan me money."
f000159,520.480,531.800,"$400 million compared to the assets that I have, all of these great properties all over the world, and frankly, The Bank of America building in San Francisco."
f000160,531.800,534.160,"I don’t love what’s happening to San Francisco."
f000161,534.160,538.880,"1290 Avenue of the Americas, one of the biggest office buildings."
f000162,538.880,540.080,"Well do I hear you right?"
f000163,540.080,542.440,"It sounds like you’re saying $400 million isn’t that much."
f000164,542.440,543.120,"But are you confirming that, yes, you do owe some $400 million?"
f000165,543.120,547.120,"What I’m saying is that, it’s a tiny percentage of my net worth."
f000166,547.120,548.240,"That sounds like yes."
f000167,548.240,551.240,"And you’ll see that soon because we’re doing things."
f000168,551.240,561.800,"We’ve given, I think it’s 108 or 112 pages of financial detail to elections, and we have to file as the president, as any politician, you have to file."
f000169,561.800,563.120,"Nobody ever looks at that."
f000170,563.120,569.960,"When they do, they see how incredible a company is, but more importantly, they see where this debt is."
f000171,569.960,572.440,"No, I don’t owe Russia money."
f000172,572.440,575.520,"I owe a very, very small… It’s called mortgages."
f000173,575.520,577.480,"People have a house, they put a mortgage."
f000174,577.480,578.040,"Any foreign bank?"
f000175,578.040,578.680,"Any foreign entity?"
f000176,578.680,587.600,"Not that I know of, but I will probably, because it’s so easy to solve, and if you’d like to do, I will let you know who I owe, whatever small amount of money."
f000177,587.600,588.720,"I want to say two things."
f000178,588.720,590.840,"Number one, it’s a very small amount of money."
f000179,590.840,593.160,"Number two, it’s very straight."
f000180,593.160,598.200,"It’s very, very straight, but it’s a tiny percentage of the worth."
f000181,598.200,600.320,"Did you ever hear the expression underlevered?"
f000182,600.320,600.560,"Yeah."
f000183,600.560,601.960,"I am extremely underlevered."
f000184,601.960,602.840,"Well, here’s the thing."
f000185,602.840,606.360,"You could clear this up tonight by just releasing your tax returns yourself."
f000186,606.360,607.320,"That’s what I don’t understand."
f000187,607.320,608.760,"I think people are just wondering, you’re the only-"
f000188,608.760,609.160,"As you know, I’m under audit."
f000189,609.160,610.120,"It turned out that I am under audit."
f000190,610.120,611.520,"Yes, but the IRS said… You are."
f000191,611.520,613.320,"But they actually… Excuse me."
f000192,613.320,613.760,"No, no."
f000193,613.760,616.680,"But the IRS says that doesn’t stop you from releasing."
f000194,616.680,618.520,"But you accused me of not being under audit previously."
f000195,618.520,619.000,"I did not."
f000196,619.000,621.360,"And so did other people at NBC."
f000197,621.360,622.080,"And I am under audit."
f000198,622.080,622.400,"You are."
f000199,622.400,624.040,"So that one’s solved."
f000200,624.040,624.360,"That’s good."
f000201,624.360,625.280,"I am under audit."
f000202,625.280,630.960,"No person in their right mind would release, prior to working out the deal with the IRS."
f000203,630.960,632.160,"And I’ll go a step further."
f000204,632.160,634.400,"I’m treated very badly by the IRS."
f000205,634.400,636.160,"They treat me very, very badly."
f000206,636.160,642.320,"You have people in there from previous administrations that treat me very badly, but we’re under audit."
f000207,642.320,645.040,"It’s very routine, in many ways, but we’re under audit."
f000208,645.040,648.400,"They like to change the game, change the rules, do everything."
f000209,648.400,650.400,"You saw what they did with the tea party people."
f000210,650.400,651.480,"You saw what they did with the religious group."
f000211,651.480,656.640,"But to be clear, there is no law or rule that prohibits you from releasing your tax returns."
f000212,656.640,676.720,"No, except common sense, and intelligence, and having lawyers that say… Because I would love to release them, and as soon as we come to a conclusion, I will release them, and very gladly, but if you go to elections, and if you take a look, you’ll see 112, I think it’s 112, it talks about the income, which is rather massive."
f000213,676.720,678.760,"It talks about all of the properties."
f000214,678.760,680.080,"They have them listed."
f000215,680.080,682.960,"You can never learn more, but you know what happened?"
f000216,682.960,683.880,"People went there."
f000217,683.880,684.720,"All the reporters went."
f000218,684.720,685.840,"There was a feeding frenzy."
f000219,685.840,688.160,"This was originally, when I filed it."
f000220,688.160,689.360,"And I filed it every year."
f000221,689.360,690.920,"I update it every year."
f000222,690.920,692.040,"My son is here."
f000223,692.040,692.520,"They run the company."
f000224,692.520,693.600,"I don’t run the company."
f000225,693.600,697.560,"It also says that you’ve paid $750 in taxes in the year you were elected."
f000226,697.560,698.440,"Is that true or not?"
f000227,698.440,700.200,"Yeah, because that’s a statutory number."
f000228,700.200,701.240,"It’s a statutory."
f000229,701.240,702.080,"But is that true?"
f000230,702.080,703.440,"I think it’s a filing number."
f000231,703.440,706.320,"You pay 750, it’s a filing or a filing fee."
f000232,706.320,706.640,"But is that all you paid?"
f000233,706.640,707.800,"Because most people here probably paid more."
f000234,707.800,708.280,"No, I don’t know."
f000235,708.280,710.040,"I can tell you this."
f000236,710.040,714.480,"If they have my tax returns, as you know, they have to go to jail."
f000237,714.480,720.280,"It’s illegal, but their numbers were wrong, but let me tell you what else."
f000238,720.280,723.640,"I don’t owe money to any of these sinister people."
f000239,723.640,725.160,"This has been going on for years now."
f000240,725.160,726.720,"Russia, Russia, Russia."
f000241,726.720,732.920,"It turned out to be a hoax, and it turned out to be that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats were dealing with Russia, not me."
f000242,732.920,734.880,"It’s a whole hoax."
f000243,734.880,744.040,"So I would not mind at all saying who it is, but it’s a very small… When you look at vast properties like I have, and they’re big, and they’re beautiful, and they’re well located."
f000244,744.040,746.080,"When you look at that, the amount of money, $400 million is a peanut."
f000245,746.080,746.720,"It’s extremely underlevered."
f000246,746.720,748.000,"And it’s levered with normal banks."
f000247,748.000,749.280,"Not a big deal."
f000248,749.280,750.680,"All right, let’s take a break."
f000249,750.680,753.080,"We’ll get more voter questions right after this."
f000250,753.080,754.000,"Thank you."
f000251,754.000,754.360,"Thank you."
f000252,754.360,756.640,"We are live in Miami, in the middle of a town hall with President Trump."
f000253,756.640,757.800,"Thank you again-"
