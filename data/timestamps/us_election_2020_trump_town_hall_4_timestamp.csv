f000001,0.000,4.320,"We are live in Miami in the middle of a town hall with President Trump."
f000002,4.320,6.000,"Thank you again for being here."
f000003,6.000,6.360,"Thank you."
f000004,6.360,8.200,"We’ve got another voter, Adam Schucher."
f000005,8.200,10.360,"He voted for Clinton in 2016."
f000006,10.360,13.600,"He’s registered as a Democrat and says he’s supporting Biden."
f000007,13.600,14.840,"Adam, take it away."
f000008,14.840,15.720,"Thank you, Savannah."
f000009,15.720,16.920,"Thank you, Mr. President."
f000010,16.920,17.040,"Thank you, Adam."
f000011,17.040,26.200,"Four years ago, Senate leadership said it was inappropriate to push through a nominee in an election year, yet they fast-tracked your nominee for the Supreme Court just today."
f000012,26.200,37.640,"The question I have for you is, what do you say to the voter that thinks it’s hypocritical to act in that manner and that they can’t trust Republicans’ word?"
f000013,37.640,43.520,"So when I was elected, and when a president is elected, they’re elected for a period of four years."
f000014,43.520,45.640,"And Justice Ginsburg said it best."
f000015,45.640,52.680,"I think, talking about president Obama having to do with somebody else, that the president is put there for four years, not for three years."
f000016,52.680,60.280,"So during this fourth year, it happened to come up, unfortunately, because I had great respect for Justice Ginsburg."
f000017,60.280,65.440,"But a vacancy happened to come up, and we picked somebody that’s outstanding."
f000018,65.440,69.080,"She has been an absolute star, and I’m extremely proud of it."
f000019,69.080,71.160,"But again, plenty of time."
f000020,71.160,72.320,"There’s plenty of time."
f000021,72.320,75.600,"We’re going to do it before the election, but we also have much time after the election."
f000022,75.600,80.760,"But there’s no reason to wait, because it’s almost unanimous, it seems to me, certainly within the Republican party."
f000023,80.760,85.400,"And frankly, most of the Democrats within closed rooms, I guarantee you that."
f000024,85.400,89.720,"This is an outstanding person, and I’m using my fourth term."
f000025,89.720,96.800,"And if you look at it and if you put the shoe on the other foot, if they had this, they would do it 100%."
f000026,96.800,99.920,"So there’s been 29 times when this has happened."
f000027,99.920,103.720,"All 29 times a president has done exactly what I’ve done."
f000028,103.720,115.680,"To the voter’s point, I’ll just say that in 2016, you were on another show, actually another morning show, and you were asked whether President Obama should nominate a Supreme Court Justice Merrick Garland."
f000029,115.680,122.840,"And you said, “I think the Senate should wait until the next president, and let the president pick.” Now that was eight months before the election."
f000030,122.840,124.600,"This is three weeks before the election."
f000031,124.600,126.440,"So I have a lot of respect, by the way, for-"
f000032,126.440,127.800,"So you have changed your position on this?"
f000033,127.800,129.400,"I have a lot of respect for Judge Garland."
f000034,129.400,130.520,"I want to tell you that."
f000035,130.520,136.720,"But I’ll tell you, the whole ball game changed when I saw the way they treated Justice Kavanaugh."
f000036,136.720,146.840,"I have never seen any human being, and I’m not just talking about Supreme Court… I have never seen a human being treated so badly with false accusations and everything else."
f000037,146.840,148.800,"I have never seen anything like it."
f000038,148.800,150.560,"And you know what the truth is, Savannah?"
f000039,150.560,153.200,"Like it or not, the ball game changed a lot."
f000040,153.200,158.840,"There has never been anybody treated so badly as, now Justice Kavanaugh."
f000041,158.840,168.240,"You’ve mentioned that you would like to see Amy Coney Barrett confirmed to the Supreme Court in case any challenges come up in connection with the election."
f000042,168.240,169.960,"Do you expect her to rule for you?"
f000043,169.960,172.880,"Well, I think she’ll have to make that decision."
f000044,172.880,175.120,"I don’t think she has any conflict at all."
f000045,175.120,180.720,"A Supreme Court judge does not have… They can make their own decision."
f000046,180.720,184.600,"They actually have additional power to make that decision."
f000047,184.600,186.800,"It would be totally up to her."
f000048,186.800,193.520,"I would think that she would be able to rule either for me or against me, being I don’t see any conflict whatsoever."
f000049,193.520,194.920,"We have an election coming up."
f000050,194.920,198.280,"I think it’s the most important election in the history of our country."
f000051,198.280,203.280,"If for any chance, and it probably won’t… And I hope it doesn’t ever get to the Supreme Court."
f000052,203.280,206.160,"But if it did, I would think that she would rule one way or the other."
f000053,206.160,206.480,"I would think so."
f000054,206.480,207.120,"But for you?"
f000055,207.120,208.440,"You think she would rule for you?"
f000056,208.440,209.400,"I have no idea."
f000057,209.400,211.920,"Of course she’ll rule one way or the other, but-"
f000058,211.920,214.520,"Because believe it or not, I never asked her about it."
f000059,214.520,216.200,"I never talked about it."
f000060,216.200,220.600,"I didn’t talk about any of the obvious things that you could talk about."
f000061,220.600,223.800,"And I think a lot of people in my position might."
f000062,223.800,230.960,"But in speaking to a lot of very brilliant people and people that do this for a living, they say it’s better not to talk."
f000063,230.960,232.840,"So I talked to her about life."
f000064,232.840,235.840,"I talked to her about the fact, “Would you like to do this?"
f000065,235.840,238.280,"Are you willing to do this?” Because it’s a tremendous burden."
f000066,238.280,245.240,"The answer was, “Yes.” She’s unbelievably well-qualified, but I never spoke to her about these various questions."
f000067,245.240,246.720,"Let’s get our next voter."
f000068,246.720,248.440,"She’s leaning to you, Mr. President."
f000069,248.440,249.920,"She voted for you in 2016."
f000070,249.920,251.560,"She is a registered Republican."
f000071,251.560,253.280,"Her name is Moriah Greene."
f000072,253.280,254.840,"Mariah, what’s your question?"
f000073,254.840,256.080,"Thank you very much."
f000074,256.080,256.440,"Thank you."
f000075,256.440,257.600,"Good evening, Mr. President."
f000076,257.600,260.840,"I’m honored to be with you here tonight, sir."
f000077,260.840,262.120,"So thank you."
f000078,262.120,263.640,"I’m a pro-life millennial."
f000079,263.640,276.520,"And my question for you today is, if Roe v. Wade is ultimately overturned in the future, what protections would be put in place or kept for where the mother’s life is in jeopardy in relation to high risk pregnancies?"
f000080,276.520,278.400,"Well, again, I’m not ruling on this."
f000081,278.400,283.880,"And Roe v. Wade is something that a lot of people would say, obviously, you’re going to speak to somebody."
f000082,283.880,291.400,"Also two other great Justices, Justice Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh… I never spoke to them about Roe v. Wade."
f000083,291.400,293.400,"I never spoke to them about election laws."
f000084,293.400,295.040,"I never spoke to them about anything."
f000085,295.040,298.280,"And I’ve done the right thing from a moral standpoint."
f000086,298.280,302.680,"I don’t even know from a legal standpoint, but it was the right thing."
f000087,302.680,312.360,"I think, depending on what happens with Roe v. Wade, I think that perhaps it could get sent down to the states, and the states would decide."
f000088,312.360,315.080,"I also think perhaps nothing will happen."
f000089,315.080,317.120,"I have not talked to her about it."
f000090,317.120,319.720,"I think it would be inappropriate to talk to her about it."
f000091,319.720,323.080,"And some people would say, “You can talk to about it.” I just think it would be inappropriate."
f000092,323.080,324.720,"But what is your preference?"
f000093,324.720,328.400,"Because agreed, that’s not something you should talk to the judge about."
f000094,328.400,331.240,"But would you like to see Roe versus Wade overturned?"
f000095,331.240,344.960,"I would like to see a brilliant jurist, a brilliant person who has done this in great depth and has actually skirted this issue for a long time, make a decision."
f000096,344.960,346.520,"And that’s why I chose her."
f000097,346.520,349.080,"I think that she’s going to make a great decision."
f000098,349.080,351.320,"I did not tell her what decision to make."
f000099,351.320,356.000,"And I think it would be inappropriate to say right now, because I don’t want to do anything to influence her."
f000100,356.000,360.120,"I want her to get approved, and then I want her to go by the law."
f000101,360.120,363.600,"And I know she’s going to make a great decision for our country, along with the other two people I put there."
f000102,363.600,365.200,"You’re running as a pro-life Republican."
f000103,365.200,369.920,"Most pro-life Republicans would like to see Roe v. Wade overturned and abortion banned."
f000104,369.920,371.400,"Many of them would."
f000105,371.400,373.480,"Perhaps most of them would."
f000106,373.480,377.240,"I am telling you, I don’t want to do anything to influence anything right now."
f000107,377.240,382.920,"I don’t want to go out tomorrow and say, “Oh, he’s trying to give her a signal.” Because I didn’t speak to her about it."
f000108,382.920,385.040,"I’ve done the right thing in so doing."
f000109,385.040,388.080,"How she’s going to rule, you’re going to find out perhaps."
f000110,388.080,388.960,"Or you might not find out."
f000111,388.960,390.600,"It may never get there."
f000112,390.600,391.800,"It may never get there."
f000113,391.800,392.680,"We’ll see what happens."
f000114,392.680,393.000,"All right."
f000115,393.000,394.280,"We have another question."
f000116,394.280,395.760,"This is Cindy Velez."
f000117,395.760,397.240,"She is undecided."
f000118,397.240,400.320,"She says she’s leaning to Biden, and she did vote for Clinton in 2016."
f000119,400.320,402.800,"She’s registered as a Democrat."
f000120,402.800,403.440,"Hi Cindy."
f000121,403.440,404.640,"What’s your question?"
f000122,404.640,405.640,"Good evening, Savannah."
f000123,405.640,407.200,"Hi, Cindy."
f000124,407.200,407.800,"Thank you."
f000125,407.800,408.640,"Good evening, Mr. President."
f000126,408.640,409.680,"Thank you very much."
f000127,409.680,419.960,"As the mother of a young male of color, I have reason to respect authority, not only because it’s the right thing to do, but also out of fear that he may face profiling or be considered a criminal."
f000128,419.960,424.720,"As an educator, I’ve also had similar conversations with my high school students."
f000129,424.720,441.240,"Mr. President, what will you and your administration do to better prepare our law enforcement officers to work in collaboration with the communities that they serve and also to protect the lives of innocent Black and Latinos from police brutality and injustice?"
f000130,441.240,441.520,"Right."
f000131,441.520,445.960,"I fully understand the question, and I saw everything that you saw over the summer."
f000132,445.960,448.800,"And it was a terrible thing, a terrible thing to watch."
f000133,448.800,454.160,"We have a Senator named Tim Scott from South Carolina."
f000134,454.160,456.760,"He came up with a bill that should have been approved."
f000135,456.760,457.680,"It was great."
f000136,457.680,467.120,"It was a bill that was strong in terms of law enforcement, and strong in terms of enforcing the proper thing, and doing the proper thing by law enforcement."
f000137,467.120,469.080,"And the Democrats just wouldn’t go for it."
f000138,469.080,470.560,"They wouldn’t go for it at all."
f000139,470.560,473.880,"And I don’t know why, because it was a really great bill."
f000140,473.880,475.960,"But I do have to say this."
f000141,475.960,479.520,"And some people don’t like it when I say it, but a lot of people agree."
f000142,479.520,483.880,"I have done more for the African American community than any president."
f000143,483.880,486.000,"With the exception of Abraham Lincoln."
f000144,486.000,492.280,"Criminal justice reform, prison reform, historically Black colleges and universities."
f000145,492.280,493.000,"I got them funded."
f000146,493.000,494.760,"They were on a year to year basis."
f000147,494.760,496.080,"They could have been put out of business."
f000148,496.080,502.400,"As soon as our country had a little bad year, they would have said, “I’m sorry, we’re not going to fund you.” I got them 10 year funding and financing."
f000149,502.400,503.840,"And more than they even asked for."
f000150,503.840,506.000,"I became very friendly with a lot of the heads."
f000151,506.000,510.400,"But we’ve done more… And of course, opportunity zones."
f000152,510.400,514.720,"But criminal justice reform, everybody said it could not be done."
f000153,514.720,517.840,"President Obama and Biden never even tried to do it."
f000154,517.840,519.400,"They never even tried."
f000155,519.400,521.080,"But I say that, and I say it often."
f000156,521.080,523.440,"I’ll say it loud, and I’m very proud of it."
f000157,523.440,529.360,"And I have a great relationship because of what I’ve done with the African-American community."
f000158,529.360,530.560,"I’m very proud of it."
f000159,530.560,532.000,"Let’s go to our next question."
f000160,532.000,534.600,"We have Paulette Dale, she leans slightly to Biden."
f000161,534.600,536.160,"She voted for Clinton in 2016."
f000162,536.160,537.840,"She’s registered as a Republican."
f000163,537.840,539.080,"Paulette, what’s your question?"
f000164,539.080,539.360,"Thank you."
f000165,539.360,541.240,"Good evening, Mr. President."
f000166,541.240,542.560,"Thank you."
f000167,542.560,543.800,"Thank you very much."
f000168,543.800,545.960,"I have to say, you have a great smile."
f000169,545.960,546.240,"Got you."
f000170,546.240,546.840,"Thank you."
f000171,546.840,551.880,"He does."
f000172,551.880,553.360,"You’re so handsome when you smile."
f000173,553.360,566.080,"As the daughter of immigrants to the United States who fled Eastern Europe due to religious persecution, the United States immigration policies are very personal for me."
f000174,566.080,567.400,"Right."
f000175,567.400,576.440,"Surveys show that most Americans, and the majority of Republicans, support the Dreamers program."
f000176,576.440,591.840,"So my question for you, Mr. President, is if you are elected to a second term, do you expect to pursue your previous efforts to cut the DACA program?"
f000177,591.840,592.080,"Yeah."
f000178,592.080,594.080,"Why or why not?"
f000179,594.080,596.120,"DACA is somewhat different than Dreamers."
f000180,596.120,600.480,"You understand that, and you understand it better than anybody, probably, in this room."
f000181,600.480,602.480,"Where do you come from, by the way, originally?"
f000182,602.480,602.800,"Where?"
f000183,602.800,605.400,"My grandparents were from Russia and Poland."
f000184,605.400,606.200,"That’s very good."
f000185,606.200,607.120,"Okay."
f000186,607.120,610.680,"So we are going to take care of DACA."
f000187,610.680,612.760,"We’re going to take care of Dreamer."
f000188,612.760,614.960,"It’s working right now."
f000189,614.960,619.880,"We’re negotiating different aspects of immigration and immigration law."
f000190,619.880,624.960,"We’ve built now, over 400 miles of border wall, southern border."
f000191,624.960,627.200,"Mexico is working very closely with us."
f000192,627.200,629.280,"We have the strongest border we’ve ever had."
f000193,629.280,630.920,"We want people to come into our country."
f000194,630.920,632.240,"They have to come in legally."
f000195,632.240,634.880,"But we are working very hard on the DACA program."
f000196,634.880,639.600,"And you will be, I think, very happy over the course of the next year."
f000197,639.600,640.000,"Thank you."
f000198,640.000,641.640,"Because I feel the same way as you do about it."
f000199,641.640,643.280,"Thank you, Mr. President."
f000200,643.280,643.640,"Thank you."
f000201,643.640,644.400,"Thank you very much."
f000202,644.400,650.320,"Mr. President, in point of fact, the DACA program… Under your administration, no new applicants are allowed."
f000203,650.320,655.360,"And in fact, the DACA recipients now have to renew every year as opposed to every two years."
f000204,655.360,659.720,"So in fact, the DACA program has been curtailed by your administration."
f000205,659.720,664.920,"Well, what happens is because of the pandemic, much changed on the immigration front."
f000206,664.920,667.280,"Mexico is heavily infected, as you know."
f000207,667.280,672.320,"And we’ve made it very, very difficult to come in because of the pandemic, and other reasons, and crime."
f000208,672.320,675.840,"But we have a very strong border right now, and we have to keep it that way."
f000209,675.840,682.400,"But we want people to come into our country, but they have to come in through a merit system, and they have to come in legally."
f000210,682.400,684.560,"And people are very, very happy with it."
f000211,684.560,687.000,"You haven’t heard any complaints about that."
f000212,687.000,692.480,"But what happened is because of the pandemic, we have to be extra cautious."
f000213,692.480,697.000,"You have been promising this immigration bill since, well, at least July, when you told my colleague on Telemundo it was coming."
f000214,697.000,699.000,"But nothing’s come yet."
f000215,699.000,699.920,"It’s very happy."
f000216,699.920,704.280,"The fact is, we got rid of catch and release, which is a disaster."
f000217,704.280,705.680,"You catch somebody."
f000218,705.680,706.480,"They could be a murderer."
f000219,706.480,709.480,"That could be a rapist, and we’re supposed to release them into our country."
f000220,709.480,711.280,"These are the laws that I inherited."
f000221,711.280,712.920,"We ended that program."
f000222,712.920,715.800,"Now, I think you’re going to see something very, very good."
f000223,715.800,720.880,"The whole immigration… If you look at what’s going on, people used to pour into our country."
f000224,720.880,726.120,"And especially during the pandemic, I think even you, Savannah, will be very impressed with what we’ve done."
f000225,726.120,728.040,"Sir, we have about 30 seconds left."
f000226,728.040,728.280,"Sure."
f000227,728.280,729.840,"I think about people sitting out there tonight."
f000228,729.840,731.080,"There are some who love you."
f000229,731.080,734.640,"Some of them are sitting right around here, and some who will never vote for you."
f000230,734.640,735.880,"But there are people in the middle."
f000231,735.880,737.360,"There are people who aren’t sure."
f000232,737.360,738.080,"That’s right."
f000233,738.080,743.800,"There are people who want to know why they should give you a second chance and how you might improve in a second term."
f000234,743.800,744.560,"30 seconds."
f000235,744.560,745.280,"What would you say to them?"
f000236,745.280,746.440,"Because I’ve done a great job."
f000237,746.440,748.520,"We have the strongest economy in the world."
f000238,748.520,749.680,"We closed it up."
f000239,749.680,751.400,"We are coming around the corner."
f000240,751.400,755.640,"The vaccines are coming out soon, and our economy is strong."
f000241,755.640,759.480,"We are at a level with jobs like we’ve never been before."
f000242,759.480,761.600,"We’ve rebuilt our military."
f000243,761.600,763.120,"We’ve rebuilt our borders."
f000244,763.120,764.240,"We had no borders."
f000245,764.240,765.520,"We had no nothing."
f000246,765.520,766.920,"We’ve rebuilt so much."
f000247,766.920,770.160,"We’ve given you the greatest tax cut in the history of our country."
f000248,770.160,773.240,"Greatest regulation cut, equally as important."
f000249,773.240,777.720,"And we created new levels of jobs that nobody thought was possible."
f000250,777.720,779.480,"And next year is going to be better than ever before."
f000251,779.480,780.280,"I got to leave it there."
f000252,780.280,781.240,"I got a wrap from the control room."
f000253,781.240,783.720,"Mr. President, thank you for your time."
f000254,783.720,787.480,"Thank you very much."
f000255,787.480,790.400,"Thank you for listening to the voters’ questions."
f000256,790.400,791.760,"That concludes our town hall."
f000257,791.760,794.840,"We do want to thank the president again, as well as our audience in hot Miami, and all of you watching at home."
f000258,794.840,803.960,"And a reminder, Donald Trump and Joe Biden are scheduled to meet in person a week from tonight in Nashville, a second and final presidential debate, moderated by our own Kristen Welker."
f000259,803.960,807.800,"Have a good evening, and thanks for being with us."
