f000001,0.000,2.520,"Welcome back to our town hall with Former Vice President Joe Biden."
f000002,2.520,10.080,"The next question comes from Mark Hoffman, Center Valley, Pennsylvania, conservative, who voted for Trump in 2016."
f000003,10.080,11.920,"Welcome to Pennsylvania, Mr. Vice President."
f000004,11.920,12.640,"Good to be back home."
f000005,12.640,13.560,"I’m from Pennsylvania."
f000006,13.560,14.280,"Yes, I know."
f000007,14.280,15.080,"Scranton, right?"
f000008,15.080,15.640,"Yep."
f000009,15.640,19.720,"So, pieces breaking out all over the world."
f000010,19.720,21.920,"Our troops are coming home."
f000011,21.920,30.880,"Serbia is talking to Kosovo and the Arabs and Israelis are talking peace which I believe is a modern day miracle what’s going on."
f000012,30.880,34.760,"Does President Trump’s foreign policy deserves some credit?"
f000013,34.760,36.840,"A little more, but not a whole lot."
f000014,36.840,40.880,"We find ourselves in a position where we’re more isolated in the world than we’ve ever been."
f000015,40.880,41.560,"Our allies-"
f000016,41.560,43.520,"Were more isolated in the world than we ever have been."
f000017,43.520,49.600,"Our allies… Our go it alone, our America first has made America alone."
f000018,49.600,54.560,"You have Iran closer to having enough nuclear material to build a bomb."
f000019,54.560,58.000,"North Korea has more bombs and missiles available to it."
f000020,58.000,62.920,"We find ourselves where our NATO allies are publicly saying they can’t count on us."
f000021,62.920,72.160,"We’re in a situation as well, where in the far East, we find ourselves, in the Western Pacific, where we’re isolated as well."
f000022,72.160,77.600,"You have Japan and South Korea at odds with one another."
f000023,77.600,80.480,"China is making moves."
f000024,80.480,85.640,"So I would say, we’re find ourselves less secure than we’ve been."
f000025,85.640,90.800,"I do compliment the president on the deal with Israel recently."
f000026,90.800,99.400,"But if you take a look, we’re not very well trusted around the world."
f000027,99.400,114.000,"When 17 major nations in the world were asked who they trust more, who’s a better leader, and the president came in behind both, the international survey, both behind Putin, as well as Xi."
f000028,114.000,117.280,"And look what Putin is doing."
f000029,117.280,121.520,"You have bounties on American militaries heads in Afghanistan."
f000030,121.520,126.760,"They have more people there now, by the way, than when we left in Afghanistan."
f000031,126.760,132.440,"And we find ourselves in a situation where he’s talked to Putin six times, hadn’t said a word to him."
f000032,132.440,138.200,"And NATO is on the risk of beginning crack because they doubt whether we’re there."
f000033,138.200,148.240,"You see what’s happened in everything from Belarus to Poland, to Hungary, and the rise of totalitarian regimes in the world."
f000034,148.240,152.920,"And as well as, this president embraces all the thugs in the world."
f000035,152.920,157.280,"He’s best friends with the leader of North Korea, sending love letters."
f000036,157.280,161.040,"He doesn’t take on Putin in any way."
f000037,161.040,168.120,"He’s learned the art of the steal from the art of the deal by Xi and China."
f000038,168.120,178.880,"So I would respectfully suggest, no, there is no plan, no coherent plan for foreign policy."
f000039,178.880,186.640,"We’ve been most effective as a world leader, in my humble opinion, not just by the exercise of our power."
f000040,186.640,191.480,"We’re the most powerful nation in the world, but the power of our example."
f000041,191.480,195.400,"That’s what’s led the rest of the world to follow us on almost everything."
f000042,195.400,199.320,"He’s pulled out of almost every international organization."
f000043,199.320,207.400,"He gets laughed at, literally, not figuratively, when he goes to the United Nations."
f000044,207.400,210.120,"It’s not about the president, per se."
f000045,210.120,214.000,"It’s about the nation and the lack of respect that’s shown to us."
f000046,214.000,216.760,"Want to get one more question in this segment, and it comes from Mieke Haeck."
f000047,216.760,219.560,"She’s from State College, Pennsylvania."
f000048,219.560,222.160,"This is your first presidential election that you’re vote in."
f000049,222.160,223.400,"It is."
f000050,223.400,224.480,"Hi, Mieke."
f000051,224.480,225.440,"How are you?"
f000052,225.440,226.560,"I’m good."
f000053,226.560,227.360,"Thank you."
f000054,227.360,231.840,"I’m the proud mom of two girls, 8 and 10."
f000055,231.840,235.000,"My youngest daughter is transgender."
f000056,235.000,253.920,"The Trump administration has attacked the rights of transgender people, banning them from military service, weakening non-discrimination protections, and even removing the word transgender from some government websites."
f000057,253.920,269.680,"How will you, as president, reverse this dangerous and discriminatory agenda and ensure that the lives and rights of LGBTQ people are protected under US law?"
f000058,269.680,272.440,"I will flat out just change the law."
f000059,272.440,276.120,"Eliminate those executive orders, number one."
f000060,276.120,283.480,"You may recall, I’m the guy who said… I was raised by a man who, I remember, I was being dropped off."
f000061,283.480,289.240,"My dad was a high school educated, well-read man who was a really decent guy."
f000062,289.240,298.520,"And I was being dropped off to get an application in the center of our city, Wilmington, Delaware, the corporate capital of the world at the time."
f000063,298.520,305.560,"I’m getting out to get an application to be a lifeguard in the African-American community, because there was a big swimming pool complex."
f000064,305.560,308.880,"And these two men, well-dressed, leaned up and hugged one another and kissed one another."
f000065,308.880,311.520,"I’m getting out of the car at the light, and I turned to my dad."
f000066,311.520,312.440,"My dad looked me."
f000067,312.440,314.040,"He said, “Joey, it’s simple."
f000068,314.040,322.320,"They love each other.” The idea that an 8 year old child or a 10 year old child decides, “I decided I want to be transgender."
f000069,322.320,323.720,"That’s what I think I’d like to be."
f000070,323.720,329.240,"It’d make my life a lot easier.” There should be zero discrimination."
f000071,329.240,335.240,"And what’s happening is too many transgender women of color are being murdered."
f000072,335.240,337.680,"They’re being murdered."
f000073,337.680,339.680,"I think it’s up to, now, 17."
f000074,339.680,343.160,"Don’t hold me to that number, but it’s… It’s higher now?"
f000075,343.160,343.680,"Yeah."
f000076,343.680,345.120,"And that’s just this year."
f000077,345.120,356.640,"And so I promise you, there is no reason to suggest that there should be any right denied your daughter, or daughters, whichever, one or two."
f000078,356.640,357.080,"One."
f000079,357.080,357.720,"One."
f000080,357.720,360.880,"Your daughter, that your other daughter has a right to be and do."
f000081,360.880,361.360,"None."
f000082,361.360,362.120,"Zero."
f000083,362.120,367.080,"And by the way, my son Beau, who passed away, was the attorney general of the state of Delaware."
f000084,367.080,372.440,"He was the guy who got the first transgender law passed in the state of Delaware."
f000085,372.440,376.120,"And because of a young man who became a woman, who worked for him in the attorney general’s office."
f000086,376.120,377.840,"We’ve got one more segment coming up."
f000087,377.840,378.320,"Thank you."
f000088,378.320,378.920,"And I’m proud of her."
f000089,378.920,379.480,"We’ll be right back."
f000090,379.480,381.920,"The vice president and the people, a special edition of 2020."
f000091,381.920,382.680,"Here again, George Stephanopoulos."
