f000001,0.000,3.480,"And welcome back to our town hall with Former Vice President Joe Biden."
f000002,3.480,5.640,"We’re going to look at the environment right now."
f000003,5.640,10.240,"We’re going to get a question from Michele Ellison and from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, businesswoman, a social worker."
f000004,10.240,14.400,"You’re a Republican who’s voted for Democrats, but you’re not sure what you’re going to do this time around."
f000005,14.400,15.240,"Correct?"
f000006,15.240,17.920,"Correct."
f000007,17.920,20.080,"Greetings Former Vice President Biden."
f000008,20.080,20.640,"Hello."
f000009,20.640,22.840,"Thank you, Mr. Stephanopoulos."
f000010,22.840,34.760,"In a 2012 report of the University of Pittsburgh’s Institute of Politics fracking was discussed and it is possible implications for the waterways from the Commonwealth to the gulf."
f000011,34.760,41.040,"Fracking has made the population sick and killed wildlife in Southwest Pennsylvania."
f000012,41.040,50.240,"The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and small business development centers have already begun to transition people away from fossil fuels."
f000013,50.240,58.240,"What industries that are not harmful to human health and the environment are you planning for Southwest Pennsylvania and the nation?"
f000014,58.240,61.840,"Well, first of all, I make it clear."
f000015,61.840,64.520,"I do not propose banning fracking."
f000016,64.520,76.280,"I think you have to make sure that fracking is in fact not emitting methane or polluting the well or dealing with what can be small earthquakes in how they’re drilling."
f000017,76.280,80.080,"So, it has to be managed very, very well, number one."
f000018,80.080,85.760,"Number two, what we have to do is the future rests in renewable energy."
f000019,85.760,104.400,"The single fastest growing energy source in the world right now, because I’m going to say something that’s going to sound self-serving, but I manage the RecoveryAact and I was able to invest billions of dollars into bringing down the cost per BTU of wind and solar."
f000020,104.400,111.560,"So now it’s cheaper than coal, is cheaper than oil right now, and it has great, great promise."
f000021,111.560,115.960,"And it’s also the fastest growing employer in the energy industry."
f000022,115.960,119.120,"And so there are a number of things that I would do immediately."
f000023,119.120,126.000,"Number one, there are well over 100,000 wells that are left uncapped in the region."
f000024,126.000,135.640,"We could hire 128,000 of these people who are working in the industry to cap these wells and get a good salary doing it now, number one."
f000025,135.640,142.600,"Number two, we should be moving toward finding the new technologies that are going to be able to deal with carbon capture."
f000026,142.600,157.200,"So, ultimately, it’s a transition we moved from, to a net zero emission of carbon that we’re still going to be able to use if we find the right technology, some gases, some gas to be able to, if we can carbon capture."
f000027,157.200,174.000,"And I think we’re going to be able to move in a direction where by the year 2035, we’ll be able to have net zero emissions of carbon from the creation of energy, energy creation so we can move it by dealing with those."
f000028,174.000,190.000,"And every time we talk about global warming or the environment, the president thinks it’s a joke and I think as jobs, because what we’re going to have happened is you’ll be able to see now, as I started to say before."
f000029,190.000,203.800,"I as president is going to invest that $600 billion that we spend in government contracts, only on those things that in fact also are not only made in America, but building an infrastructure that’s clean and new."
f000030,203.800,212.840,"And what we have to do is focus on the transmission of energy across the country from areas relating to solar and wind."
f000031,212.840,216.760,"The reason is that they have not, that has not been mastered yet."
f000032,216.760,218.640,"I met a lot of people in Silicon Valley."
f000033,218.640,230.160,"The battery technology is increasing significantly so you’re going to be able to have, for example, solar on your home and a battery the, this by this by this, as I’m showing you here in your basement."
f000034,230.160,233.680,"So when the sun doesn’t shine for five days, you still have enough energy."
f000035,233.680,236.320,"So, we’re making significant progress."
f000036,236.320,239.720,"The other thing we’re going to do is provide an awful lot of work."
f000037,239.720,253.240,"It’s estimated to put close to a million people to work by weatherizing four million buildings and two million homes, because we’ll save tons and tons of energy or billions of barrels of energy over time."
f000038,253.240,259.680,"And at the same time provide significant employment and a good union wages, prevailing wages."
f000039,259.680,261.800,"Let me stick on fracking for a second day."
f000040,261.800,264.160,"You said you don’t want to ban fracking."
f000041,264.160,265.960,"As you know, it’s an important issue here in Pennsylvania."
f000042,265.960,267.680,"Not everyone buys your denial."
f000043,267.680,283.160,"A member of the Boilermakers Local 154 Shawn Steffee was quoted in the New York Times today saying “You can’t have it both ways.” It says, “You can’t meet your goal to end fossil fuels without ending fracking.” What do you say to people like Shawn who doubt your denial because they think you want to keep that promise [crosstalk 01:04:34]?"
f000044,283.160,284.800,"[crosstalk 01:04:34] Boilermaker’s overwhelming endorsement."
f000045,284.800,285.240,"Okay?"
f000046,285.240,293.680,"So, the Boilermakers Union has endorsed me because I sat down with them and went in a great detail with leadership exactly what I would do, number one."
f000047,293.680,300.240,"Number two, what I would do is I would giving tax breaks and subsidizing oil."
f000048,300.240,304.120,"We don’t need to subsidize oil any longer, number one."
f000049,304.120,306.720,"We should stop that and save billions of dollars over time."
f000050,306.720,316.920,"What I would also do with regard to there’s no, the difference between me and the new green deal, they say automatically by 2030 we’re going to be carbon free."
f000051,316.920,317.520,"Not possible."
f000052,317.520,318.720,"So, are you for or against it?"
f000053,318.720,324.480,"You say you’re not for it, but in your website, it says you call it a crucial framework, the green deal."
f000054,324.480,327.480,"My deal is a crucial framework, but not the new green deal."
f000055,327.480,334.720,"The new green deal calls for elimination of all non renewable energy by 2030."
f000056,334.720,335.880,"You can’t get there."
f000057,335.880,348.800,"You’re going to need to be able to transition, George, to be able to transition to get to the place where we invest in new technologies that allow us to do things that get us to a place where we get to net zero emission, including in agriculture."
f000058,348.800,350.080,"I’ve laid out a detailed plan."
f000059,350.080,362.600,"We should be taking the plan where we allow significant more land to be put in conservation, plant deep rooted plants which absorb carbon from the air and in fact, pay farmers to do it."
f000060,362.600,374.880,"We can do things like pelletize all the chicken manure and all the horse manure and cow manure, and take out the methane and use it as fertilizer and make a lot of money doing it."
f000061,374.880,380.560,"For example, right now, down in … And people when I say that, they wonder what I’m talking about."
f000062,380.560,383.760,"The biggest carbon sink in the world is the Amazon."
f000063,383.760,396.160,"More carbon absorbed from the air diminishing global warming in the Amazon than all the carbon emitted on a yearly basis from the United States of America from all vehicles on all means."
f000064,396.160,399.080,"So we have to use our imaginations."
f000065,399.080,403.840,"We have to move in the direction as well providing for electric vehicles."
f000066,403.840,412.160,"Electric vehicles will save billions of gallons of oil, [inaudible 01:06:38] estimated, not me, Wall street, one million automobile jobs, but we’re lagging me."
f000067,412.160,413.120,"I mean, we’re not investing."
f000068,413.120,414.920,"We’re not doing any of the research."
f000069,414.920,415.880,"Got to take another quick break."
f000070,415.880,416.800,"We’ll be right back."
