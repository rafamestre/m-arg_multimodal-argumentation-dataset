f000001,0.000,2.880,"And welcome back to our town hall with former Vice President Joe Biden."
f000002,2.880,8.400,"The next question comes from Keenan Wilson, Narberth, Pennsylvania, Democrat."
f000003,8.400,9.560,"Good evening."
f000004,9.560,16.800,"You say that you committed to entering this race after the events of Charlottesville in 2017."
f000005,16.800,23.040,"I assume that that feeling that prompted you to run will not go away once the results are determined."
f000006,23.040,39.760,"So hypothetically, if you lose, how will you use your platform to urge President Donald Trump, and those rallying behind him, towards the ideals of a more perfect union?"
f000007,39.760,47.000,"Well, to be very honest with you, I think that’s very hard."
f000008,47.000,53.920,"Things have not let themselves to him learning from what’s happened, what’s gone before."
f000009,53.920,66.160,"Instead of being chastened by being one of the few presidents, the only president to be impeached and then have a member of his own party vote to expel him, it emboldened him."
f000010,66.160,72.240,"But what I will do… Hopefully, I’ll go back to being a professor at the University of Pennsylvania."
f000011,72.240,87.760,"And making the case that I’ve been made, and at the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware, focusing on these same issues, relating to what constitutes decency and honor in this country."
f000012,87.760,91.520,"It’s the thing that got me involved in public life to begin with."
f000013,91.520,97.240,"As a kid, I’d moved from Scranton, where there were no African-Americans and moved down to Claymont, Delaware."
f000014,97.240,102.320,"And in Delaware we have the eight largest Black population, as a percent of population."
f000015,102.320,106.600,"It was an epiphany for me seeing what was going on, and I got deeply involved."
f000016,106.600,107.880,"I’m no great shakes."
f000017,107.880,109.640,"I wasn’t John Lewis."
f000018,109.640,111.640,"I don’t mean to imply that."
f000019,111.640,115.600,"But it’s the thing that’s motivated… My dad used to have an expression for real."
f000020,115.600,118.960,"He said, “Everyone’s entitled to be treated with dignity."
f000021,118.960,121.040,"Everybody.” And it was real."
f000022,121.040,122.360,"Everybody is."
f000023,122.360,137.600,"And so whether I’m a defeated candidate for president back teaching or I’m elected president, it is a major element of everything that I’m about, because it reflects who we are as a nation."
f000024,137.600,145.960,"Every single solitary generation, the dial has moved closer and closer and more and more to inclusion."
f000025,145.960,153.480,"And we are a country that is a country of slaves who came here 400 years ago, Indigenous people, and everyone else is an immigrant."
f000026,153.480,156.080,"And we’re a diverse country."
f000027,156.080,160.840,"And unless we are able to treat people equally, we’re just never going to meet our potential."
f000028,160.840,164.040,"But I think the American people want to see that happen."
f000029,164.040,166.360,"I think they’re ready to see it happen."
f000030,166.360,170.160,"And I’d tell you one thing, if I’m elected president, you will not hear me race baiting."
f000031,170.160,171.600,"You’ll not hear me dividing."
f000032,171.600,176.000,"You’ll hear me trying to unify, and bring people together."
f000033,176.000,182.480,"When I said I was running because I wanted to unify the country, people said, “Well, there are the old days.” We better be able to do it again."
f000034,182.480,183.400,"Agreed."
f000035,183.400,186.120,"We’d better be able to do it again."
f000036,186.120,193.320,"Mr. Vice President, if you lose, what will that say to you about where America is today?"
f000037,193.320,199.840,"Well, it could say I’m a lousy candidate, and I didn’t do a good job."
f000038,199.840,214.520,"But I hope that it doesn’t say that we are as racially, ethnically, and religiously at odds with one another as it appears the president wants us to be."
f000039,214.520,220.120,"Usually, the president’s in my view, with all due respect, has been divide and conquer."
f000040,220.120,222.920,"The way he does better if he splits us."
f000041,222.920,224.560,"There’s division."
f000042,224.560,227.160,"And I think people need hope."
f000043,227.160,231.920,"Look, George, I’ve never been more optimistic about the prospect for this country than I am today."
f000044,231.920,233.240,"And I really mean that."
f000045,233.240,234.880,"I think the people are ready."
f000046,234.880,239.160,"They understand what’s at stake, and it’s not about Democrat or Republican."
f000047,239.160,244.640,"If I get elected, I’m running as a proud Democrat, but I’m going to be an American president."
f000048,244.640,248.920,"I’m going to take care of those who voted against me, as well as those who voted for me, for real."
f000049,248.920,250.480,"That’s a presence too."
f000050,250.480,257.880,"We got to heal this nation, because we have the greatest opportunity to any country in the world to own the 21st century."
f000051,257.880,259.360,"And we can’t do it divided."
f000052,259.360,259.600,"One more break."
f000053,259.600,260.160,"We’ll be right back."
