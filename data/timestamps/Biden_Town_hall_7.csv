f000001,0.000,3.320,"And we are wrapping up our town hall with former Vice President Joe Biden."
f000002,3.320,7.600,"Mr. Vice President, as you know, President Trump had a town hall meeting tonight, as well."
f000003,7.600,13.640,"During that town hall meeting, he was asked several times whether he took a COVID test the day of your last debate."
f000004,13.640,16.640,"You’re supposed to have another debate a week from tonight."
f000005,16.640,18.120,"Just two quick questions."
f000006,18.120,19.560,"Do you expect that debate to happen?"
f000007,19.560,25.160,"Will you demand that President Trump take a test that day and that it be negative before you debate?"
f000008,25.160,25.520,"Yeah."
f000009,25.520,29.080,"And by the way, before I came up here, I took another test."
f000010,29.080,33.440,"I’ve been taking them every day, the deep test, the ones that go in most."
f000011,33.440,40.840,"Because if I had not passed that test, I didn’t want to come here and expose anybody."
f000012,40.840,51.040,"And I just think it’s just decency, to be able to determine whether or not you’re clear."
f000013,51.040,62.080,"I’m less concerned about me, but then the guys with the cameras, the people working in the Secret Service guys you drive up with, all those people."
f000014,62.080,64.840,"And so, yes, I believe he will do that."
f000015,64.840,69.400,"Look, I’m going to abide by what the commission rules call for."
f000016,69.400,73.160,"I was prepared to debate him remotely, which was supposed to happen."
f000017,73.160,79.080,"And he said he wouldn’t do that, a virtual debate, or a town hall."
f000018,79.080,80.520,"He didn’t want to do that."
f000019,80.520,81.880,"I didn’t set those rules."
f000020,81.880,84.920,"The commission set the rules."
f000021,84.920,90.480,"So whatever rules they set, I’m confident that the Cleveland Clinic is the one overseeing it."
f000022,90.480,93.440,"I think they’re going to not let happen what happened last time."
f000023,93.440,95.840,"They’re going to demand that it’s safe."
f000024,95.840,97.280,"But you expect to be there?"
f000025,97.280,97.960,"I expect to be there."
f000026,97.960,100.720,"Mr. Vice President, thank you for your time tonight."
f000027,100.720,102.360,"Thanks to all the questioners here."
f000028,102.360,103.760,"It was really terrific questions."
f000029,103.760,105.320,"I think you did a service to our democracy tonight."
f000030,105.320,105.880,"Thank you very much."
f000031,105.880,107.480,"I want to go back to my colleague, David Muir, in New York."
