f000001,0.000,4.400,"I’d like to talk about China."
f000002,4.400,13.480,"We have as our next topic, we have no more complicated or consequential foreign relationship than the one with China."
f000003,13.480,16.200,"It is a huge market for American agricultural goods."
f000004,16.200,27.080,"It’s a potential partner in dealing with climate change in North Korea and in a video tonight, President Trump again, blamed it for the Coronavirus saying China will pay."
f000005,27.080,32.440,"Vice President Pence, how would you describe our fundamental relationship with China?"
f000006,32.440,33.400,"Competitors?"
f000007,33.400,34.560,"Adversaries?"
f000008,34.560,35.640,"Enemies?"
f000009,35.640,36.840,"You have two minutes."
f000010,36.840,39.640,"Thank you, Susan."
f000011,39.640,45.440,"Well, before I leave that, let me speak to voting records if I can."
f000012,45.440,51.040,"Everybody knows that NAFTA costs literally thousands of American factories to close."
f000013,51.040,53.200,"We saw automotive jobs go South of the border."
f000014,53.200,56.840,"President Trump fought to renegotiate NAFTA."
f000015,56.840,61.040,"In the United States, Mexico and Canada the agreement is now the law of the land."
f000016,61.040,68.520,"American people deserve to know Senator Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against the USMCA."
f000017,68.520,72.120,"It was a huge win for American auto workers."
f000018,72.120,77.280,"It was a huge win for American farmers, especially dairy in the upper Midwest."
f000019,77.280,87.400,"But Senator you said it didn’t go far enough on climate change, you put your radical environmental agenda ahead of American auto workers and a head of American jobs."
f000020,87.400,106.040,"I think the American people deserve to know that it’s probably why Newsweek magazine said that Kamala Harris was the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019, more liberal than Bernie Sanders, more liberal than any of the others in the United States Senate."
f000021,106.040,118.840,"So now with regard to China, Susan first and foremost, China is to blame for the coronavirus and President Trump is not happy about it."
f000022,118.840,126.040,"He’s made that very clear, made it clear again today that China and the world health organization did not play straight with the American people."
f000023,126.040,133.000,"They did not let our personnel into China to get information on the Coronavirus until the middle of February."
f000024,133.000,144.560,"Fortunately, President Trump in dealing with China from the outset of this administration, standing up to China that had been taking advantage of America for decades in the wake of Joe Biden’s cheerleading for China."
f000025,144.560,150.640,"President Trump made that decision before the end of January to suspend all travel from China."
f000026,150.640,157.920,"And again, the American people deserve to know Joe Biden opposed President Trump’s decision to suspend all travel from China."
f000027,157.920,159.160,"He said it was hysterical."
f000028,159.160,159.720,"He said it was-"
f000029,159.720,160.800,"Thank you Vice President Pence."
f000030,160.800,162.120,"The President Trump has stood up-"
f000031,162.120,163.040,"Vice President Pence, your time is up."
f000032,163.040,163.200,"To China."
f000033,163.200,164.960,"We’re going to continue to stand strong."
f000034,164.960,165.880,"Thank you Vice President Pence."
f000035,165.880,170.200,"We want to improve the relationship, but we’re going to level the playing field and we’re going to hold China accountable-"
f000036,170.200,170.840,"Vice President Pence."
f000037,170.840,172.800,"for what they did to America with the coronavirus."
f000038,172.800,173.880,"Thank you."
f000039,173.880,178.320,"Senator Harris, let me ask you the same question that I asked the vice-president."
f000040,178.320,181.800,"How would you describe our fundamental relationship with China?"
f000041,181.800,183.560,"Are we competitors?"
f000042,183.560,184.680,"Adversaries?"
f000043,184.680,185.800,"Enemies?"
f000044,185.800,188.920,"You’ll have two minutes uninterrupted."
f000045,188.920,205.280,"Susan, the Trump administration’s perspective and approach to China has resulted in the loss of American lives, American jobs, and America’s standing."
f000046,205.280,217.680,"There is a weird obsession that President Trump has had with getting rid of whatever accomplishment was achieved by President Obama and Vice President Biden."
f000047,217.680,226.360,"For example, they created within the White House and office that basically was responsible for monitoring pandemics."
f000048,226.360,227.160,"They got rid of it."
f000049,227.160,229.280,"Not true."
f000050,229.280,243.720,"There was a team of disease experts that President Obama and Vice President Biden dispatched to China to monitor what is now predictable and what might happen."
f000051,243.720,245.600,"They pulled them out."
f000052,245.600,253.480,"We now are looking at 210,000 Americans who have lost their lives."
f000053,253.480,255.800,"Let’s look at the job situation."
f000054,255.800,262.160,"We mentioned before, the trade deal, the trade war, they wanted to call it with China."
f000055,262.160,276.760,"It resulted in the loss of over 300 manufacturing jobs and a manufacturing recession and the American consumer paid thousands of dollars, more for goods because of that failed war that they called it."
f000056,276.760,278.280,"Then let’s talk about standing."
f000057,278.280,299.440,"Pew, a reputable research firm has done an analysis that shows that leaders of all of our formerly allied countries have now decided that they hold in greater esteem and respect Xi Jinping the head of the Chinese communist party than they do Donald Trump."
f000058,299.440,304.200,"The President of the United States, the commander in chief of the United States."
f000059,304.200,310.360,"This is where we are today because of a failure of leadership by this administration."
f000060,310.360,320.320,"Senator Harris, we’ve seen changes in the role of the United States in terms of global leadership over the past four years."
f000061,320.320,322.520,"And of course times do change."
f000062,322.520,323.960,"What’s your definition?"
f000063,323.960,331.960,"We’ve seen strains with China, of course, as the vice president mentioned, we’ve seen strange with our traditional allies in NATO and elsewhere."
f000064,331.960,340.240,"What is your definition of the role of American leadership in 2020?"
f000065,340.240,345.680,"So I love talking with Joe about a lot of these issues and Joe, I think he said it quite well."
f000066,345.680,352.520,"He says, “Foreign policy, it might sound complicated, but really it’s relationships.” Just think about it as relationships."
f000067,352.520,358.600,"So we know this in our personal and professional relationships, you got to keep your word to your friends."
f000068,358.600,359.840,"Got to be loyal to your friends."
f000069,359.840,363.120,"People who’ve stood with, you got to stand with them."
f000070,363.120,368.000,"You got to know who your adversaries are and keep them in check."
f000071,368.000,378.440,"But what we have seen with Donald Trump is that he has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world."
f000072,378.440,383.680,"Let’s take for example, Russia."
f000073,383.680,386.560,"So I serve on the intelligence committee of the United States Senate."
f000074,386.560,397.640,"America’s Intelligence Community told us Russia interfered in the election of the president of the United States in 2016 and his plan in 2020."
f000075,397.640,411.960,"Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI said the same, but Donald Trump, the commander in chief of the United States of America prefers to take the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of the American Intelligence Community."
f000076,411.960,417.520,"You look at our friends at NATO, he has walked away from agreements."
f000077,417.520,431.000,"You can look at the Iran nuclear deal, which now has put us in a position where we are less safe because they are building up what might end up being a significant nuclear arsenal."
f000078,431.000,432.640,"We were in that deal guys."
f000079,432.640,436.120,"We were in the Iran nuclear deal with friends, with allies around the country."
f000080,436.120,446.480,"And because of Donald Trump’s unilateral approach to foreign policy, coupled with his isolationism, he pulled us out and has made America less safe."
f000081,446.480,448.880,"So Susan it’s about relationships."
f000082,448.880,460.480,"And the thing that has always been part of the strength of our nation in addition to our great military has been that we keep our word, but Donald Trump doesn’t understand that because he doesn’t understand what it means to be honest."
f000083,460.480,461.320,"Thank you."
f000084,461.320,464.040,"He doesn’t understand what it means to be honest."
f000085,464.040,465.120,"Thank you, Senator Harris."
f000086,465.120,467.280,"Vice President Pence, let me give you a chance to respond."
f000087,467.280,468.280,"Thank you."
f000088,468.280,475.080,"Well, President Trump kept his word when we moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the state of Israel."
f000089,475.080,477.960,"When Joe Biden was vice president, they promised to do that and they never did."
f000090,477.960,482.680,"We stood strong with our allies, but we’ve been demanding."
f000091,482.680,488.560,"NATO is now contributing more to our common defense than ever before thanks to President Trump’s leadership."
f000092,488.560,497.480,"We’ve strengthened our alliances across the Asia Pacific, and we’ve stood strong against those who would do us harm."
f000093,497.480,519.000,"When President Trump came into office, ISIS had captured an area of the middle East, the size of Pennsylvania, but President Trump unleashed the American military and our armed forces destroy the ISIS caliphate and took down their leader, al-Baghdadi without one American casualty."
f000094,519.000,526.920,"Al-Baghdadi was responsible for the death of thousands, but notably America’s hearts today are with the family of Kayla Mueller."
f000095,526.920,530.800,"Her parents, which are here with us tonight in Salt Lake City."
f000096,530.800,541.080,"Today, two of the ISIS killers responsible for Kayla Mueller’s murder were brought to justice in the United States."
f000097,541.080,544.280,"Jihadi John was killed on the battlefield along with the other beetle."
f000098,544.280,551.400,"The reality is that when Joe Biden was vice president, we had an opportunity to save Kayla Mueller."
f000099,551.400,559.400,"Breaks my heart to reflect on it, but the military came into the oval office, presented a plan, they said they knew where Kayla was."
f000100,559.400,576.000,"Baghdadi had held her for 18 months, abused or mercilessly before they killed her, but when Joe Biden was Vice President they hesitated for a month, and when armed forces finally went in, it was clear she’d been moved two days earlier."
f000101,576.000,585.080,"And her family says with a heart that broke the heart of every American, that if president Donald Trump had been president, they believe Kayla would be alive today."
f000102,585.080,587.040,"Thank you, Vice President Pence."
f000103,587.040,591.840,"So, if we destroy the ISIS caliphate and you talk about re-entering the Iran nuclear deal."
f000104,591.840,596.880,"I mean the last administration transferred $1.8 billion to the leading state sponsor of terrorism."
f000105,596.880,598.920,"Thank you, Vice President Pence."
f000106,598.920,600.920,"President Donald Trump got us out of the deal-"
f000107,600.920,602.360,"Thank you, Vice President Pence."
f000108,602.360,605.040,"… And when Qassem Soleimani was traveling to Baghdad-"
f000109,605.040,606.400,"Thank you, Vice President Pence."
f000110,606.400,610.320,"… To do harm to Americans, President Donald Trump took him out-"
f000111,610.320,611.360,"Thank you, Vice President Pence."
f000112,611.360,617.400,"… And America is safer, our allies are safer and the American people know president Donald Trump will never take action [crosstalk 00:00:16:40]."
f000113,617.400,618.560,"Thank you, Vice President Pence."
f000114,618.560,624.440,"I would like to give Senator Harris a chance to respond, but not at such great length, because of course there are other topics we want to talk about."
f000115,624.440,625.600,"But I would like equal time."
f000116,625.600,626.040,"Yes."
f000117,626.040,626.520,"Thank you."
f000118,626.520,627.120,"Please go ahead."
f000119,627.120,634.160,"First of all, to the Mueller family, I know about your daughter’s case, and I’m so sorry."
f000120,634.160,636.160,"I’m so sorry."
f000121,636.160,652.840,"What happened to her is awful and it should have never happened, and I know Joe feels the same way, and I know that president Obama feels the same way, but you mentioned Soleimani."
f000122,652.840,653.920,"Let’s start there."
f000123,653.920,671.480,"So, after the strike on Soleimani, there was a counter strike on our troops in Iraq, and they suffered serious brain injuries, and do you know what Donald Trump dismissed them as?"
f000124,671.480,672.560,"Headaches."
f000125,672.560,683.120,"And this is about a pattern of Donald Trump’s where he has referred to our men who are serving in our military as suckers and losers."
f000126,683.120,702.200,"Donald Trump, who went to Arlington cemetery and stood above the graves of our fallen heroes and said, “What’s in it for them?” Because of course, he only thinks about what’s in it for him."
f000127,702.200,717.040,"Let’s take what he said about John McCain, a great American hero, and Donald Trump says, “He doesn’t deserve to be called a hero because it was a prisoner of war.”"
f000128,717.040,726.160,"Take, and this is very important when you want to talk about who is the current commander in chief and what they care about and what they don’t care about."
f000129,726.160,733.880,"Public reporting that Russia had bounties on the heads of American soldiers."
f000130,733.880,735.320,"And you know what a bounty is?"
f000131,735.320,748.720,"It’s somebody puts a price on your head and they will pay it if you are killed, and Donald Trump had talked at least six times to Vladimir Putin and never brought up the subject."
f000132,748.720,750.560,"Joe Biden would never do that."
f000133,750.560,751.080,"Thank you-"
f000134,751.080,764.000,"But Joe Biden would hold Russia to account for any threat to our nation security or to our troops who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of our democracy and our safety."
f000135,764.000,766.160,"Thank you, Senator Harris."
f000136,766.160,770.200,"This is such an important issue, but we have other important issues as well."
f000137,770.200,772.760,"And I want to make sure we have a chance to talk about-"
f000138,772.760,773.880,"I really have to respond to that."
f000139,773.880,775.040,"She has-"
f000140,775.040,776.400,"15 seconds, because we’re trying to keep-"
f000141,776.400,777.600,"Well, I’ve got to have more then that."
f000142,777.600,778.200,"Look-"
f000143,778.200,781.360,"I’m sorry, Vice President, but you’ve had more time than she said so far-"
f000144,781.360,788.640,"Slanders against President Donald Trump regarding men and women of our armed forces are absurd."
f000145,788.640,790.800,"I’m sorry, Vice President Pence-"
f000146,790.800,792.680,"My son is in captain in the United States Marine Corps."
f000147,792.680,796.080,"My son-in-law’s deployed in the United States Navy."
f000148,796.080,807.920,"I can assure all of you with sons and daughters serving in our military, President Donald Trump, not only respects, but reveres all of those who serve in our armed forces and any suggestion, otherwise is ridiculous."
f000149,807.920,813.360,"Let me also say the American people deserve to know-"
f000150,813.360,818.400,"Vice President Pence, I didn’t not create the rules for tonight-"
f000151,818.400,819.800,"… Joe Biden [crosstalk 00:20:00]."
f000152,819.800,824.320,"… You’re campaigns agreed to the rules for tonight’s debate with the commission on president’s race."
f000153,824.320,832.240,"I’m here to enforce them, which involves moving from one topic to another giving roughly equal time to both of you, which is what I’m trying very hard to do."
f000154,832.240,832.800,"Go right ahead."
f000155,832.800,840.280,"So, I want to go ahead and move to the next topic, which is an important one as the last topic was, and that is the Supreme Court."
f000156,840.280,848.200,"On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to open hearings on Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme court."
f000157,848.200,850.800,"Senator Harris, you’ll be there as a member of the committee."
f000158,850.800,851.000,"Yes."
f000159,851.000,861.720,"Her confirmation would submit the court’s conservative majority and make it likely open to more abortion restrictions, even to overturning the landmark Roe V Wade ruling."
f000160,861.720,865.080,"Access to abortion would then be up to the States."
f000161,865.080,868.840,"Vice President Pence, you’re the former governor of Indiana."
f000162,868.840,873.800,"If Roe V Wade is overturned, what would you want Indiana to do?"
f000163,873.800,876.360,"Would you want your home state to ban all abortions?"
f000164,876.360,878.920,"You have two minutes uninterrupted."
f000165,878.920,884.760,"Well, thank you for the question, but I’ll use a little bit of my time to respond to that very important issue before."
f000166,884.760,894.320,"The American people deserve to know Qassem Soleimani, the Iranian general was responsible for the death of hundreds of American service members."
f000167,894.320,899.280,"When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans."
f000168,899.280,913.120,"President Trump didn’t hesitate and Qassem Soleimani is gone, but you deserve to know the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out Qassem Soleimani."
f000169,913.120,922.600,"it’s really inexplicably, but with regard to Joe Biden, it’s explainable because history records a Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against a Osama bin Ladin."
f000170,922.600,940.320,"It’s absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American service members, and that’s what you have in President Donald Trump."
f000171,940.320,944.400,"Now with regard to the Supreme court-"
f000172,944.400,944.400,"[Silence]."
f000173,944.400,964.600,"… become Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and she’s a brilliant woman and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizeable American family to the Supreme court of the United States, and our hope is in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Cavenaugh received with treatment from you and others, that we hope she gets a fair hearing."
f000174,964.600,972.520,"And we particularly hope that we don’t see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before."
f000175,972.520,990.160,"I mean, the Democrat chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed for the court of appeals, expressed concern that the dogma of her faith lived loudly and her, and Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern."
f000176,990.160,997.960,"Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees you actually attacked, because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus."
f000177,997.960,1001.440,"Just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views-"
f000178,1001.440,1002.040,"Thank you, Vice President."
f000179,1002.040,1003.000,"Your time is up."
f000180,1003.000,1003.000,"… And [crosstalk 00:23:06]."
f000181,1003.000,1005.480,"So, my hope is that when the hearing takes place that-"
f000182,1005.480,1006.960,"Thank you, Vice President Pence."
f000183,1006.960,1010.720,"… That Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be respectfully voted and confirmed into the Supreme court of the United States."
f000184,1010.720,1012.280,"Thank you, Vice President Pence."
f000185,1012.280,1012.800,"Thank you."
f000186,1012.800,1017.040,"Senator Harris, you’re the Senator from and former Attorney General of California."
f000187,1017.040,1020.840,"So, let me ask you a parallel question to the one I posed to the Vice President."
f000188,1020.840,1025.520,"If Roe V Wade is overturned, what would you want California to do?"
f000189,1025.520,1029.760,"Would you want your home state to enact no restrictions on access to abortion?"
f000190,1029.760,1032.560,"And you have two minutes uninterrupted."
f000191,1032.560,1033.720,"Thank you, Susan."
f000192,1033.720,1052.360,"First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith, and it’s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe, if elected, will be only the second practicing Catholic as President of the United States."
f000193,1052.360,1073.080,"On the issue of this nomination, Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people, we are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next President of the United States, and before, when this conversation has come up, it’s been about election year or election time."
f000194,1073.080,1075.520,"We’re literally in an election."
f000195,1075.520,1079.120,"Over 4 million people have voted."
f000196,1079.120,1082.960,"People are in the process of voting right now."
f000197,1082.960,1090.720,"And so, Joe has been very clear, as the American people are, let the American people fill that seat in the White House."
f000198,1090.720,1098.440,"And then we’ll fill that seat on the United States Supreme court, and to your point, Susan, the issues before us, couldn’t be more serious."
f000199,1098.440,1104.240,"There’s the issue of choice and I will always fight for a woman’s right to make a decision about her own body."
f000200,1104.240,1111.960,"It should be her decision and not that Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence, but let’s also look at what else is before the court."
f000201,1111.960,1131.600,"It’s the Affordable Care Act like literally in the midst of a public health pandemic when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a preexisting condition because you contracted the virus."
f000202,1131.600,1140.000,"Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, and I said it before, and it bears repeating."
f000203,1140.000,1146.240,"This means that there will be no more protections if they win for people with pre-existing conditions."
f000204,1146.240,1151.160,"This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage."
f000205,1151.160,1158.560,"It means that if you’re under the age of 26, you can’t stay on your parents’ coverage anymore, and here’s the thing."
f000206,1158.560,1160.880,"The contrast couldn’t be more clear."
f000207,1160.880,1163.160,"They’re trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act."
f000208,1163.160,1163.520,"Thank you, Senator-"
f000209,1163.520,1165.480,"Joe Biden is saying let’s expand coverage."
f000210,1165.480,1168.640,"Let’s give you a choice of a public option or private coverage."
f000211,1168.640,1170.120,"Let’s bring down premiums-"
f000212,1170.120,1170.800,"Thank you Senator Harris."
f000213,1170.800,1172.240,"… Let’s lower Medicare eligibility to 60."
f000214,1172.240,1173.760,"Thank you, Senator Harris."
f000215,1173.760,1175.800,"That’s true leadership."
f000216,1175.800,1192.680,"You’ve mentioned earlier, Vice President Pence, that the president was committed to maintaining protections for people with pre-existing conditions, but you do have this court case that you are supporting, your administration supporting that would strike down the Affordable Care Act."
f000217,1192.680,1205.640,"The president says, President Trump says that he’s going to protect people with preexisting conditions, but he has not explained how he would do that, and that was one of the toughest nuts to crack when they were passing the Affordable Care Act."
f000218,1205.640,1216.000,"So, tell us specifically, how would your administration protect Americans with preexisting conditions to have access to affordable insurance if the Affordable Care Act is struck down?"
f000219,1216.000,1221.600,"Well, thank you, Susan, but let me just say, addressing your very first question."
f000220,1221.600,1228.920,"I couldn’t be more proud to serve as vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life."
f000221,1228.920,1230.920,"I’m pro-life."
f000222,1230.920,1237.960,"I don’t apologize for it, and this is another one of those cases where there’s such a dramatic contrast."
f000223,1237.960,1244.400,"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth."
f000224,1244.400,1246.160,"Late term abortion."
f000225,1246.160,1249.560,"They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America."
f000226,1249.560,1260.240,"For our part, I would never presume how Judge Amy Coney Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States, but we’ll continue to stand strong for the right to life."
f000227,1260.240,1265.720,"When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris."
f000228,1265.720,1271.280,"Are you and Joe Biden going to pack the court if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed?"
f000229,1271.280,1278.120,"I mean, there’ve been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years from George Washington to Barack Obama."
f000230,1278.120,1291.480,"Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases, but your party is actually openly advocating, adding seats to the Supreme court, which has had nine seats for 150 years if you don’t get your way."
f000231,1291.480,1295.480,"This is a classic case of if you can’t win by the rules, you’re going to change the rules."
f000232,1295.480,1296.840,"Now you’ve refused to answer the question."
f000233,1296.840,1297.840,"Joe Biden has refused to answer the question-"
f000234,1297.840,1298.760,"No, you’ve refused to answer the question."
f000235,1298.760,1299.600,"Joe Biden has refused to answer the question."
f000236,1299.600,1306.480,"So I think the American people would really like to know if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed at the Supreme Court of the United States."
f000237,1306.480,1313.040,"Are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way?"
f000238,1313.040,1316.400,"I’m so glad we went through a little history lesson."
f000239,1316.400,1317.720,"Let’s do that a little more."
f000240,1317.720,1320.080,"In 1864-"
f000241,1320.080,1321.200,"No, I’d like you to answer the question."
f000242,1321.200,1321.560,"Yes, she’s-"
f000243,1321.560,1323.920,"Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking, I’m speaking."
f000244,1323.920,1325.160,"Okay."
f000245,1325.160,1335.000,"In 1864, one of the, I think political heroes, certainly the President, I assume you also, Mr. Vice President, is Abraham Lincoln."
f000246,1335.000,1341.760,"Abraham Lincoln was up for reelection and it was 27 days before the election."
f000247,1341.760,1346.000,"And a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court."
f000248,1346.000,1350.280,"Abraham Lincoln’s party was in charge, not only of the White House, but the Senate."
f000249,1350.280,1355.720,"But Honest Aid said, “It’s not the right thing to do."
f000250,1355.720,1361.840,"The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next president of the United States."
f000251,1361.840,1381.480,"And then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land.” And so Joe and I are very clear: the American people are voting right now and it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime."
f000252,1381.480,1382.280,"Thank you."
f000253,1382.280,1383.680,"Senator Harris-"
f000254,1383.680,1388.000,"People, Susan, are voting right now."
f000255,1388.000,1394.400,"They’d like to know if you and Joe Biden are going to pack the Supreme Court if you don’t get your way in this nomination."
f000256,1394.400,1395.640,"Let’s talk about packing-"
f000257,1395.640,1397.840,"You, once again, gave a non-answer."
f000258,1397.840,1399.160,"Joe Biden gave a non-answer."
f000259,1399.160,1400.320,"I’m trying to answer you now."
f000260,1400.320,1408.720,"You know the people deserve a straight answer, and if you haven’t figured it out yet, the straight answer is they are going to pack the Supreme Court if they somehow win this election."
f000261,1408.720,1424.240,"Men and women, I got to tell you people across this country, if you cherish our Supreme Court, if you cherish the separation of powers, you need to reject the Biden Harris ticket come November the third, reelect President Donald Trump, and we’ll stand by that separation powers in a nine seats Supreme Court."
f000262,1424.240,1424.520,"Yeah."
f000263,1424.520,1426.520,"Let’s talk about packing the court then."
f000264,1426.520,1428.480,"Let’s talk about the fact."
f000265,1428.480,1428.520,"Please."
f000266,1428.520,1429.680,"Yeah, I’m about to."
f000267,1429.680,1457.000,"So the Trump Pence administration has been, because I sit on the Senate judiciary committee, Susan as you mentioned, and I’ve witnessed the appointments for lifetime appointments to the federal courts, district courts, courts of appeal, people who are purely ideological, people who have been reviewed by legal professional organizations and found who have been not competent are substandard."
f000268,1457.000,1468.400,"And do you know that of the 50 people who President Trump appointed to the court of appeals for lifetime appointments, not one is black?"
f000269,1468.400,1470.800,"This is what they’ve been doing."
f000270,1470.800,1472.800,"You want to talk about packing a court?"
f000271,1472.800,1474.040,"Let’s have that discussion."
f000272,1474.040,1474.920,"All right."
f000273,1474.920,1475.520,"Thank you."
f000274,1475.520,1476.360,"Thank you, Senator."
f000275,1476.360,1480.000,"Let’s go on and talk about the issue of racial justice."
f000276,1480.000,1482.520,"I just want the record to reflect she never answered the question."
f000277,1482.520,1487.520,"Maybe in the next debate Joe Biden will answer the question, but I think the American people know the answer."
f000278,1487.520,1488.800,"Thank you, Vice President."
f000279,1488.800,1500.840,"In March, Breonna Taylor, a 26 year old emergency room technician in Louisville was shot and killed after police officers executing a search warrant in an aquatics investigation, broke into her apartment."
f000280,1500.840,1503.960,"The police said they identified themselves."
f000281,1503.960,1507.000,"Taylor’s boyfriend said he didn’t hear them do that."
f000282,1507.000,1511.480,"He used a gun registered to him to fire a shot, which wounded an officer."
f000283,1511.480,1514.880,"The officers then fired more than 20 rounds into the apartment."
f000284,1514.880,1517.480,"They say they were acting in self-defense."
f000285,1517.480,1520.480,"None of them have been indicted in connection with her death."
f000286,1520.480,1526.560,"Senator Harris, in the case of Breonna Taylor was justice done?"
f000287,1526.560,1527.920,"You have two minutes."
f000288,1527.920,1529.920,"I don’t believe so."
f000289,1529.920,1537.040,"And I’ve talked with Breonna’s mother, Tamika Palmer and her family and her family deserves justice."
f000290,1537.040,1538.440,"She was a beautiful young woman."
f000291,1538.440,1551.400,"She had as her life goal to become a nurse and she wanted to become an EMT to first learn what’s going on out on the street so she could then become a nurse and save lives."
f000292,1551.400,1557.800,"And her life was taken justifiably and tragically and violently."
f000293,1557.800,1576.680,"And it brings me to the eight minutes and 46 seconds that America witnessed during which an American man was tortured and killed under the knee of an armed uniformed police officer."
f000294,1576.680,1599.320,"And people around our country of every race, of every age, of every gender, perfect strangers to each other, marched shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, fighting for us to finally achieve that ideal of equal justice under law."
f000295,1599.320,1602.520,"And I was a part of those peaceful protests."
f000296,1602.520,1618.200,"And I believe strongly that first of all, we are never going to condone violence, but we always must fight for the values that we hold dear, including the fight to achieve our ideals."
f000297,1618.200,1624.360,"And that’s why Joe Biden and I have said on this subject, look, and I’m a former career prosecutor."
f000298,1624.360,1625.800,"I know what I’m talking about."
f000299,1625.800,1627.960,"Bad cops are bad for good cops."
f000300,1627.960,1637.600,"We need reform of our policing in America and our criminal justice system, which is why Joe and I will immediately ban choke holes and carotid holes."
f000301,1637.600,1639.720,"George Floyd would be alive today if we did that."
f000302,1639.720,1644.840,"We will require a national registry for police officers who break the law."
f000303,1644.840,1654.360,"We will, on the issue of criminal justice reform, get rid of private prisons and cash bail and we will decriminalize marijuana."
f000304,1654.360,1654.920,"Thank you."
f000305,1654.920,1656.200,"Thank you, Senator Harris."
f000306,1656.200,1659.560,"And we will expunge the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana."
f000307,1659.560,1661.080,"This is a time for leadership-"
f000308,1661.080,1662.480,"Thank you, Senator Harris."
f000309,1662.480,1663.440,"on a tragic, tragic issue-"
f000310,1663.440,1665.040,"Senator Harris, your time is up."
f000311,1665.040,1665.800,"Of honor on Black people in America who [crosstalk 00:34:11]."
f000312,1665.800,1667.120,"Thank you, Senator Harris."
f000313,1667.120,1670.440,"Vice President Pence, let me pose the same question to you."
f000314,1670.440,1674.320,"In the case of Breonna Taylor, was justice done?"
f000315,1674.320,1680.440,"You have two minutes uninterrupted."
f000316,1680.440,1687.280,"Well, our heart breaks for the loss of any innocent American life and the family of Breonna Taylor has our sympathies."
f000317,1687.280,1693.960,"But I trust our justice system, a grand jury that refuse the evidence."
f000318,1693.960,1702.840,"And it really is remarkable that as a former prosecutor, you would assume that an impaneled grand jury looking at all the evidence, got it wrong."
f000319,1702.840,1705.960,"But you’re entitled to your opinion, Senator."
f000320,1705.960,1712.880,"I think, and with regard to George Floyd, there’s no excuse for what happened to George Floyd."
f000321,1712.880,1721.000,"Justice will be served, but there’s also no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed."
f000322,1721.000,1724.120,"I mean, it really is astonishing."
f000323,1724.120,1726.880,"Flora Westbrook is with us here tonight in Salt Lake city."
f000324,1726.880,1737.880,"Just a few weeks ago, I stood at what used to be her salon, it was burned to the ground by rioters and looters."
f000325,1737.880,1742.240,"And Flora is still trying to put her life back together."
f000326,1742.240,1770.360,"And I must tell you, this presumption that you hear consistently from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that America is systemically racist, and that as Joe Biden said that he believes that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities is a great insult to the men and women who serve in law enforcement."
f000327,1770.360,1777.280,"And I want everyone to know who puts on the uniform of law enforcement every day, President Trump and I stand with you."
f000328,1777.280,1798.080,"And it is remarkable that when Senator Tim Scott tried to pass a police reform bill, brought together a group of Republicans and Democrats, Senator Harris, you got up and walked out of the room and then you filibustered Senator Tim Scott’s bill on the Senate floor that would have provided new accountability, new repeat resources."
f000329,1798.080,1806.600,"We don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement, proving public safety and supporting our African-American neighbors and all of our minorities."
f000330,1806.600,1808.000,"Under President Trump’s leadership-"
f000331,1808.000,1808.840,"Thank you, Vice President."
f000332,1808.840,1811.840,"We’ll always stand with law enforcement and we’ll do what we’ve done-"
f000333,1811.840,1813.680,"Vice President Pence, thank you."
f000334,1813.680,1814.440,"Your time is up."
f000335,1814.440,1819.000,"From day one, it is improve the lives of African-Americans, record unemployment, record investments in education."
f000336,1819.000,1819.520,"Thank you, Vice President Pence."
f000337,1819.520,1820.720,"Vice President Pence, your time is up."
f000338,1820.720,1821.880,"We’ll fight for school choice for all of [crosstalk 00:36:46]."
f000339,1821.880,1822.880,"I’d like to respond."
f000340,1822.880,1824.360,"Senator Harris."
f000341,1824.360,1830.520,"I will not sit here and be lectured by the Vice President on what it means to enforce the laws of our country."
f000342,1830.520,1837.640,"The only one on this stage, who has personally prosecuted everything from child sexual assault to homicide."
f000343,1837.640,1844.120,"I’m the only one on this stage who has prosecuted the big banks for taking advantage of America’s homeowners."
f000344,1844.120,1850.360,"I am the only one on this stage who prosecuted for-profit colleges for taking advantage of our veterans."
f000345,1850.360,1866.920,"And the reality of this is that we are talking about an election in 27 days where last week the President of the United States took a debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists."
f000346,1866.920,1867.480,"Not."
f000347,1867.480,1868.920,"Not true."
f000348,1868.920,1872.120,"And it wasn’t like he didn’t have a chance."
f000349,1872.120,1874.000,"He didn’t do it."
f000350,1874.000,1875.320,"And then he doubled down."
f000351,1875.320,1888.520,"And then he said, “when pressed, stand back, stand by.” And this is a part of a pattern of Donald Trump’s."
f000352,1888.520,1893.920,"He called Mexicans rapists and criminals."
f000353,1893.920,1897.920,"He instituted as his first act, a Muslim ban."
f000354,1897.920,1908.360,"He on the issue of Charlottesville, where people were peacefully protesting the need for racial justice, where a young woman was killed."
f000355,1908.360,1919.040,"And on the other side, there were neo-Nazis carrying Tiki torches, shouting racial epithets, anti-Semitic slurs."
f000356,1919.040,1929.960,"And Donald Trump when asked about it said, “There were fine people on both sides.” This is who we have as the President of the United States and America, you deserve better."
f000357,1929.960,1933.800,"Joe Biden will be a president who brings our country together-"
f000358,1933.800,1934.480,"Senator Harris."
f000359,1934.480,1941.480,"And recognizes the beauty in our diversity and the fact that we all have so much more in common than what separates us."
f000360,1941.480,1943.840,"Vice President let me give you a minute to respond."
f000361,1943.840,1945.640,"Thank you, Susan."
f000362,1945.640,1947.000,"I appreciate that very much."
f000363,1947.000,1962.080,"I think this is one of the things that makes people dislike the media so much in this country, Susan, is that you selectively edit just like Senator Harris did, comments that President Trump and I and others on our side made."
f000364,1962.080,1977.600,"I mean, Senator Harris conveniently admitted after the President made comments about people on either side of the debate over monuments, he condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and has done so repeatedly."
f000365,1977.600,1981.280,"You’re concerned that he doesn’t condemn neo-Nazis."
f000366,1981.280,1983.600,"President Trump has Jewish grandchildren."
f000367,1983.600,1986.080,"His daughter and son-in-law are Jewish."
f000368,1986.080,1991.960,"This is a President who respects and cherishes all of the American people."
f000369,1991.960,1994.800,"But you talk about having personally prosecuted."
f000370,1994.800,1996.720,"I’m glad you brought up your record, Senator."
f000371,1996.720,1997.800,"Thank you."
f000372,1997.800,1999.000,"I really need to make this point."
f000373,1999.000,2011.840,"When you were DA in San Francisco, when you left office, African-Americans were 19 times more likely to be prosecuted for minor drug offenses than whites and Hispanics."
f000374,2011.840,2020.080,"When you were Attorney General of California, you increased the disproportionate incarceration of blacks in California."
f000375,2020.080,2020.520,"Thank you."
f000376,2020.520,2023.720,"You did nothing on criminal justice reform in California."
f000377,2023.720,2027.320,"You didn’t lift a finger to pass the first step back on Capitol Hill."
f000378,2027.320,2030.760,"I mean, the reality is your record speaks for itself."
f000379,2030.760,2031.880,"Thank you Vice President."
f000380,2031.880,2034.240,"President Trump and I have fought for criminal justice before-"
f000381,2034.240,2035.240,"Thank you Vice President."
f000382,2035.240,2039.400,"We fought for educational choice and opportunities for African-Americans and all of our members."
f000383,2039.400,2041.000,"Thank you, sir."
f000384,2041.000,2042.360,"And we’ll do it for four more years."
f000385,2042.360,2042.600,"Thank you."
f000386,2042.600,2048.640,"There is no more important issue than the final issue that we’re going to talk about tonight and that is the issue of the election itself."
f000387,2048.640,2049.560,"But he attacked my record."
f000388,2049.560,2050.920,"I would like an opportunity to respond to."
f000389,2050.920,2054.680,"Let me give you 30 seconds because we’re running out of time."
f000390,2054.680,2057.000,"I appreciate that."
f000391,2057.000,2070.680,"First of all, having served as the Attorney General of the state of California, the work that I did is a model of what our nation needs to do, and we will be able to do under a Joe Biden presidency."
f000392,2070.680,2076.160,"Our agenda includes what this administration has failed to do."
f000393,2076.160,2081.680,"It will be about not only instituting a ban on choke holes and carotid holes-"
f000394,2081.680,2082.640,"Thank you."
f000395,2082.640,2083.920,"Thank you Senator Harris."
f000396,2083.920,2084.560,"I would like to go through-"
f000397,2084.560,2086.480,"These are points that you made earlier in the hour."
f000398,2086.480,2088.920,"And I want to talk about the election itself before we have to [crosstalk 00:41:13]."
f000399,2088.920,2102.600,"But I want to talk about the connection between what Joe and I will do in my record, which includes I was the first statewide officer to institute a requirement that my agents would wear body cameras and keep them on full-time."
f000400,2102.600,2115.840,"We were the first to initiate a requirement that there would be a training for law enforcement on implicit bias because yes, Joe Biden and I recognize that implicit bias does exist, Mr. Vice President, contrary to what you may believe."
f000401,2115.840,2121.080,"We did the work of instituting reforms that were about investing in re-entry."
f000402,2121.080,2124.920,"This is the work that we have done and the work we will do going forward."
f000403,2124.920,2136.680,"And again, I will not be lectured by the Vice President on our record of what we have done in terms of law enforcement and keeping our community safe and a commitment to reforming the criminal justice system of America."
f000404,2136.680,2137.800,"Thank you, Senator-"
f000405,2137.800,2140.480,"And a commitment to reforming the criminal justice system of America."
f000406,2140.480,2142.240,"Thank you, Senator Harris."
f000407,2142.240,2146.640,"And I’d like you to respond first to the question on our final topic, the election itself."
f000408,2146.640,2153.440,"President Trump has several times refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election."
f000409,2153.440,2162.880,"If your ticket wins and president Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what steps would you and vice president Biden then take?"
f000410,2162.880,2163.800,"What would happen next?"
f000411,2163.800,2165.560,"You have two minutes."
f000412,2165.560,2168.880,"So I’ll tell you."
f000413,2168.880,2176.600,"Joe and I are particularly proud of the coalition that we’ve built around our campaign."
f000414,2176.600,2181.840,"We probably have one of the broadest coalitions of folks that you’ve ever seen in a presidential race."
f000415,2181.840,2187.040,"Of course, we have the support of Democrats, but also independents and Republicans."
f000416,2187.040,2193.360,"In fact, seven members of president George W. Bush’s cabinet are supporting our ticket."
f000417,2193.360,2200.400,"We have the support of Colin Powell, Cindy McCain, John Kasich."
f000418,2200.400,2209.680,"Over 500 generals, retired generals and former national security experts and advisors are supporting our campaign."
f000419,2209.680,2225.880,"And I believe they are doing that because they know that Joe Biden has a deep, deep seated commitment to fight for our democracy, and to fight for the integrity of our democracy, and to bring integrity back to the White House."
f000420,2225.880,2231.400,"We believe in the American people, we believe in our democracy, and here’s what I’d like to say to everybody."
f000421,2231.400,2237.560,"Vote, please vote, vote early, come up with a plan to vote, go to Iwillvote.com."
f000422,2237.560,2239.960,"You can also go to Joebiden.com."
f000423,2239.960,2250.400,"We have it within our power in these next 27 days to make the decision about what will be the course of our country for the next four years."
f000424,2250.400,2257.080,"And it is within our power, and if we use our vote and we use our voice, we will win."
f000425,2257.080,2273.520,"And we will not let anyone subvert our democracy with what Donald Trump has been doing as he did on the debate stage last week, when, again, in front of 70 million people, he openly attempted to suppress the vote."
f000426,2273.520,2284.800,"Joe Biden, on the other hand, on that same debate stage, because clearly Donald Trump doesn’t think he can run on a record because it’s a failed record, Joe Biden on that stage said, Hey, just please vote."
f000427,2284.800,2286.400,"So I’ll repeat what Joe said."
f000428,2286.400,2287.120,"Please vote."
f000429,2287.120,2288.720,"Thank you, Senator."
f000430,2288.720,2295.480,"Vice president Pence, president Trump has several times refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election."
f000431,2295.480,2305.520,"If vice president Biden is declared the winner and president Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what would be your role and responsibility as vice president?"
f000432,2305.520,2307.440,"What would you personally do?"
f000433,2307.440,2308.960,"You have two minutes."
f000434,2308.960,2312.800,"Well, Susan, first and foremost, I think we’re going to win this election."
f000435,2312.800,2331.080,"Because while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rattle off a long litany of the establishment in Washington, DC and establishment that Joe Biden’s been a part of for 47 years, president Donald Trump has as launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life."
f000436,2331.080,2339.840,"And I have every confidence that the same Americans that delivered that historic victory in 2016, they see this president’s record where we rebuild our military."
f000437,2339.840,2347.640,"We revived our economy through tax cuts and rolling back regulation, fighting for fair trade, unleashing American energy."
f000438,2347.640,2350.800,"We appointed conservatives to our federal courts at every level."
f000439,2350.800,2355.360,"And we stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day."
f000440,2355.360,2359.680,"And I think that movement of Americans has only grown stronger in the last four years."
f000441,2359.680,2365.400,"But when you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you."
f000442,2365.400,2371.600,"Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election."
f000443,2371.600,2373.520,"It’s amazing."
f000444,2373.520,2380.920,"When Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, the FBI actually spied on president Trump and my campaign."
f000445,2380.920,2391.240,"I mean, there were documents released this week that the CIA actually made a referral to the FBI, documenting that those allegations were coming from the Hillary Clinton campaign."
f000446,2391.240,2405.480,"And of course, we’ve all seen the avalanche, what you put the country through for the better part of three years, until it was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion, case closed."
f000447,2405.480,2414.480,"And then Senator Harris, you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the president of the United States over a phone call."
f000448,2414.480,2420.880,"And now Hillary Clinton has actually said to Joe Biden that, in her words, under no circumstances, should he concede the election."
f000449,2420.880,2424.200,"So let me just say, I think we’re going to win this election."
f000450,2424.200,2435.160,"President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail in voting that’ll create a massive opportunity for voter fraud."
f000451,2435.160,2437.280,"And we have a free and fair election."
f000452,2437.280,2439.440,"We know we’re going to have confidence in it."
f000453,2439.440,2444.400,"And I believe in all my heart that president Donald Trump is going to be reelected for four more years."
f000454,2444.400,2453.560,"I’ve written all the questions that I’ve asked tonight, but for the final question of the debate, I’d like to read a question that someone else wrote."
f000455,2453.560,2461.400,"The Utah Debate Commission asked students in the state to write essays about what they would like to ask you."
f000456,2461.400,2465.560,"And I want to close tonight’s debate with the question posed by Brecklin Brown."
f000457,2465.560,2469.840,"She’s an eighth grader at Springville Junior High in Springville, Utah."
f000458,2469.840,2470.760,"And here’s what she wrote."
f000459,2470.760,2478.160,"“When I watch the news, all I see is arguing between Democrats and Republicans."
f000460,2478.160,2483.160,"When I watch the news, all I see is citizen fighting against citizen."
f000461,2483.160,2489.200,"When I watch the news, all I see are two candidates from opposing parties trying to tear each other down."
f000462,2489.200,2506.280,"If our leaders can’t get along, how are the citizens supposed to get along?” And then she added, “Your examples could make all the difference to bring us together.” So to each of you in turn, I’d like you to take one minute and respond to Brecklin."
f000463,2506.280,2507.840,"Vice president Pence, you have one minute."
f000464,2507.840,2509.960,"Brecklin, it’s a wonderful question."
f000465,2509.960,2517.880,"And let me just commend you for taking an interest in public life."
f000466,2517.880,2520.560,"I started following the news when I was very young."
f000467,2520.560,2526.520,"And in America, we believe in a free and open exchange of debate."
f000468,2526.520,2528.760,"And we celebrate that."
f000469,2528.760,2535.080,"It’s how we’ve created literally the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world."
f000470,2535.080,2547.040,"I would tell you that, don’t assume that what you’re seeing on your local news networks is synonymous with the American people."
f000471,2547.040,2557.400,"I look at the relationship between Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg, the late justice who we just lost from the Supreme Court, and the late justice Antonin Scalia."
f000472,2557.400,2562.280,"They were on polar opposites on the Supreme Court of the United States."
f000473,2562.280,2564.640,"One very liberal one, very conservative."
f000474,2564.640,2571.120,"But what’s been learned since her passing was the two of them and their families were the very closest of friends."
f000475,2571.120,2574.200,"Here in America, we can disagree."
f000476,2574.200,2578.200,"We can debate vigorously as Senator Harris and I have on this stage tonight."
f000477,2578.200,2582.480,"But when the debate is over, we come together as Americans."
f000478,2582.480,2586.720,"And that’s what people do, in big cities and small towns all across this country."
f000479,2586.720,2588.600,"So I just want to encourage you, Brecklin."
f000480,2588.600,2596.600,"I want to tell you that we’re going to work every day to have government as good as our people, and the American people each and every day."
f000481,2596.600,2598.320,"Love a good debate."
f000482,2598.320,2599.520,"We love a good argument."
f000483,2599.520,2604.600,"But we always come together and are always there for one another in times of need."
f000484,2604.600,2607.800,"And we’ve especially learned that through the difficulties of this year."
f000485,2607.800,2608.720,"Thank you, vice president."
f000486,2608.720,2613.680,"Senator Harris, what would you say to Brecklin?"
f000487,2613.680,2617.520,"First of all, I love hearing from our young leaders."
f000488,2617.520,2632.400,"And when I hear her words, when I hear your words, Brecklin, I know our future is bright because it is that perspective on who we are and who we should be that is a sign of leadership, and is something we should all aspire to be."
f000489,2632.400,2635.600,"And brings me to Joe, Joe Biden."
f000490,2635.600,2644.600,"One of the reasons that Joe decided to run for president is after Charlottesville, which we talked about earlier."
f000491,2644.600,2651.080,"It so troubled him and upset him like it did all of us, that there was that kind of hate and division."
f000492,2651.080,2659.760,"What propelled Joe to run for president was to see that over the course of the last four years, what Brecklin described has been happening."
f000493,2659.760,2665.800,"Joe has a longstanding reputation of working across the aisle, and working in a bipartisan way."
f000494,2665.800,2671.280,"And that’s what he’s going to do as president."
f000495,2671.280,2675.800,"Joe Biden has a history of lifting people up and fighting for their dignity."
f000496,2675.800,2679.680,"You have to know Joe’s story to know that Joe has known pain."
f000497,2679.680,2681.400,"He has known suffering."
f000498,2681.400,2683.200,"And he has known love."
f000499,2683.200,2690.040,"Brecklin, when you think about the future, I do believe the future is bright."
f000500,2690.040,2699.160,"And it will be because of your leadership, and it will be because we fight for each person’s voice through their vote."
f000501,2699.160,2712.120,"And we get engaged in this election, because you have the ability through your work and through, eventually, your vote, to determine the future of our country and what its leadership looks like."
f000502,2712.120,2714.680,"Thank you, Senator Harris."
f000503,2714.680,2715.680,"Thank you, vice president Pence."
f000504,2715.680,2717.600,"Thank you so much for being with us tonight."
f000505,2717.600,2722.120,"We want to thank also the University of Utah for its hospitality."
f000506,2722.120,2727.400,"And most of all, our thanks to all the Americans who watched this debate tonight."
f000507,2727.400,2735.080,"Again, our best wishes for a quick recovery to president Trump, the First Lady, and everyone who is battling COVID-19."
f000508,2735.080,2742.080,"The second presidential debate is next week on October 15, a town hall style debate in Miami."
f000509,2742.080,2743.680,"We hope you’ll join us then."
f000510,2743.680,2745.280,"Good evening."
