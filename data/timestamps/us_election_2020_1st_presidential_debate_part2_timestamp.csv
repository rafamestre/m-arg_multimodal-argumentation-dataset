f000002,1.080,18.440,"Vice-President Biden, you say that President Trump’s response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president."
f000003,18.440,19.720,"Oh yeah, sure."
f000004,19.720,28.560,"President Trump, you have often said that you believe you will have done more for Black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln."
f000005,28.560,29.160,"That’s true."
f000006,29.160,38.880,"My question for the two of you, is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years?"
f000007,38.880,41.680,"Vice President Biden, you go first."
f000008,41.680,43.880,"It’s about equity and equality."
f000009,43.880,45.400,"It’s about decency."
f000010,45.400,47.640,"It’s about the constitution."
f000011,47.640,55.320,"And we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America."
f000012,55.320,60.240,"But we’ve never accomplished it, but we’ve never walked away from it like he has done."
f000013,60.240,74.320,"It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people… Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan."
f000014,74.320,77.560,"A young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought."
f000015,77.560,83.360,"He said, “There were very fine people on both sides.” No president’s ever said anything like that."
f000016,83.360,83.360,"[crosstalk 00:27:10]."
f000017,83.360,84.560,"It is his-"

f000019,85.160,86.080,"… minute sir."
f000020,86.080,95.040,"… second point I’d make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House."
f000021,95.040,96.000,"What did he do?"
f000022,96.000,103.680,"He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible."
f000023,103.680,105.600,"And then what happened after that?"
f000024,105.600,109.040,"The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace."
f000025,109.040,115.280,"The general who was with him said all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all."
f000026,115.280,122.960,"This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racists hatred, racist division."
f000027,122.960,133.160,"This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus."
f000028,133.160,138.520,"And if he doesn’t do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed."
f000029,138.520,142.840,"One in 500 African Americans."
f000030,142.840,145.440,"This man is as a savior of African-Americans?"
f000031,145.440,147.680,"This man cares at all?"
f000032,147.680,149.920,"This man’s done virtually nothing."
f000033,149.920,153.560,"Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about."
f000034,153.560,155.480,"You have to look at what he did."
f000035,155.480,159.480,"And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community."
f000036,159.480,160.040,"So-"
f000037,160.040,161.960,"President Trump, you have two minutes."
f000038,161.960,167.000,"Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal race issues?"
f000039,167.000,171.840,"You did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators."
f000040,171.840,175.080,"African-Americans are super predators and they’ve never forgotten it."
f000041,175.080,176.000,"They’ve never forgotten it."
f000042,176.000,176.600,"I’ve never said-"
f000043,176.600,177.120,"No, no, sir."
f000044,177.120,177.440,"It’s his two minutes."
f000045,177.440,190.160,"So you did that and they call you a super predator and I’m letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country."
f000046,190.160,199.520,"You did the 1990… And that’s why, if you look at the polls, I’m doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did."
f000047,199.520,203.320,"You call them super predators, and you’ve called them worse than that."
f000048,203.320,207.200,"Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you’ve called them a lot worse than that."
f000049,207.200,217.240,"As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support."
f000050,217.240,221.840,"Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States."
f000051,221.840,222.600,"I have Florida."
f000052,222.600,223.880,"I have Texas."
f000053,223.880,225.440,"I have Ohio."
f000054,225.440,232.160,"I have every… Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, “I support President Trump.”"
f000055,232.160,233.880,"I don’t think you have any law enforcement."
f000056,233.880,235.920,"You can’t even say the word law enforcement."
f000057,235.920,240.000,"Because if you say those words, you’re going to lose all of your radical left supporters."
f000058,240.000,242.160,"And why aren’t you saying those words, Joe?"
f000059,242.160,243.960,"Why don’t you say the words law enforcement?"
f000060,243.960,245.280,"Because you know what?"
f000061,245.280,249.360,"If called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour."
f000062,249.360,252.880,"But they won’t do it, because they’re run by radical left Democrats."
f000063,252.880,262.000,"If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle."
f000064,262.000,267.320,"Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don’t."
f000065,267.320,274.880,"The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left."
f000066,274.880,280.760,"And they’ve got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don’t want to say anything about law and order."
f000067,280.760,287.040,"And I’ll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you’re afraid to even say it."
f000068,287.040,288.040,"All right."
f000069,288.040,290.800,"I want to return to the question of race."
f000070,290.800,311.800,"Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, “Whether justice could be equally applied in America.” Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for Blacks in this country?"
f000071,311.800,312.920,"Yes, there is."
f000072,312.920,321.840,"There’s systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced."
f000073,321.840,327.000,"But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women."
f000074,327.000,331.000,"They risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples."
f000075,331.000,334.480,"And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out."
f000076,334.480,336.160,"They have to be held accountable."
f000077,336.160,337.920,"They have to be held accountable."
f000078,337.920,350.240,"And what I’m going to do as President of the United States is call together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we’re going to work this out."
f000079,350.240,351.520,"We’re going to work this out."
f000080,351.520,356.200,"So we changed the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen."
f000081,356.200,359.800,"These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to George Floyd."
f000082,359.800,364.160,"These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor."
f000083,364.160,373.640,"Most don’t like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when… And by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate."
f000084,373.640,376.720,"Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate."
f000085,376.720,377.360,"All right, Mr.-"
f000086,377.360,378.880,"What is peaceful protest?"
f000087,378.880,380.600,"When they run through the middle of the town-"
f000088,380.600,381.520,"President Trump-"
f000089,381.520,383.800,"… and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place- [crosstalk 00:32:14]."
f000090,383.800,385.240,"That is not peaceful protest."
f000091,385.240,387.560,"No it’s not, but you say it is."
f000092,387.560,390.000,"President Trump, I’d like to continue with the issue of race."
f000093,390.000,393.080,"I promise we’re going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment."
f000094,393.080,393.560,"Fine."
f000095,393.560,405.760,"This month, your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory."
f000096,405.760,409.920,"Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training?"
f000097,409.920,414.040,"And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?"
f000098,414.040,416.160,"I ended it because it’s racist."
f000099,416.160,422.320,"I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane."
f000100,422.320,431.440,"That it a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place."
f000101,431.440,433.680,"And you know it, and so does everybody else."
f000102,433.680,434.400,"And he would know it- [crosstalk 00:33:02]"
f000103,434.400,437.600,"What is radical about racial sensitivity training?"
f000104,437.600,441.600,"If you were a certain person, you had no status in life."
f000105,441.600,442.880,"It was sort of a reversal."
f000106,442.880,450.800,"And if you look at the people, we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas."
f000107,450.800,455.960,"And really, they were teaching people to hate our country And I’m not going to do that."
f000108,455.960,458.320,"I’m not going to allow that to happen."
f000109,458.320,461.400,"We have to go back to the core values of this country."
f000110,461.400,465.800,"They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place."
f000111,465.800,466.680,"It’s a racist place."
f000112,466.680,469.480,"And they were teaching people to hate our country."
f000113,469.480,470.880,"And I’m not going to allow that to happen."
f000114,470.880,471.840,"Vice President Biden."
f000115,471.840,473.920,"Nobody’s doing that."
f000116,473.920,475.160,"He’s the racist."
f000117,475.160,477.120,"You just don’t know."
f000118,477.120,478.000,"Here’s the deal."
f000119,478.000,478.640,"I know a lot more about this- [crosstalk 00:15:43]."
f000120,478.640,480.640,"Let him finish."
f000121,480.640,483.320,"The fact is that there is racial insensitivity."
f000122,483.320,491.120,"People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them."
f000123,491.120,493.320,"It’s important people know."
f000124,493.320,498.640,"Many people don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings, but it makes a big difference."
f000125,498.640,504.040,"It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem."
f000126,504.040,509.320,"It’s a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people."
f000127,509.320,514.480,"They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, who grow up in Scranton."
f000128,514.480,516.400,"They look down on people who don’t have money."
f000129,516.400,519.000,"They look down on people who are of a different faith."
f000130,519.000,521.680,"They looked down on people who are a different color."
f000131,521.680,523.560,"In fact, we’re all Americans."
f000132,523.560,527.120,"The only way we’re going to bring this country together is bring everybody together."
f000133,527.120,530.240,"There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together."
f000134,530.240,533.720,"We can take this on and we can defeat racism in American."
f000135,533.720,535.680,"Vice President… I mean, President Trump, sir."
f000136,535.680,540.240,"During the Obama-Biden administration, there was tremendous division."
f000137,540.240,541.720,"There was hatred."
f000138,541.720,547.360,"You look at Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very… Many places, look at Oakland."
f000139,547.360,548.680,"Look what happened in Oakland."
f000140,548.680,550.000,"Look what happened in Baltimore."
f000141,550.000,553.680,"Look what happened… Frankly, it was more violent than what I’m even seeing now."
f000142,553.680,553.960,"Oh my Lord."
f000143,553.960,554.880,"But the reason-"
f000144,554.880,555.840,"This is ridiculous."
f000145,555.840,558.240,"… is that the Democrats that run these cities-"
f000146,558.240,559.000,"Absolutely ridiculous."
f000147,559.000,561.080,"… don’t want to talk, like you, about law and order."
f000148,561.080,562.240,"Violent crime-"
f000149,562.240,563.320,"And you still haven’t mentioned."
f000150,563.320,564.280,"Are you in favor of law and order?"
f000151,564.280,566.000,"I’m in favor of law."
f000152,566.000,566.280,"You- [crosstalk 00:35:15]."
f000153,566.280,568.040,"Are you in favor of law and order?"
f000154,568.040,568.040,"[crosstalk 00:35:17]"
f000155,568.040,570.440,"You asked a question, let him finish."
f000156,570.440,572.800,"[crosstalk 00:35:18] Let him answer."
f000157,572.800,576.080,"Law and order with justice, where people get treated fairly."
f000158,576.080,576.400,"Okay."
f000159,576.400,582.360,"And the fact of the matter is, violent crime went down 17%, 15% in our administration."
f000160,582.360,584.200,"It’s gone up on his watch."
f000161,584.200,587.120,"It went down much more in ours."
f000162,587.120,593.920,"All right, we’re done- [crosstalk 00:35:35] Mr. President, you’re going to be very happy because we’re now going to talk about law and order."
f000163,593.920,596.960,"The places we had trouble were democratic run cities-"
f000164,596.960,598.560,"That’s exactly my question."
f000165,598.560,606.640,"There has been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer particularly, and you often blame that on democratic mayors and democratic governors."
f000166,606.640,610.440,"But in fact, there have been equivalent spikes in Republican led cities, like Tulsa and Fort Worth."
f000167,610.440,612.280,"So the question is, is this really a…"
f000168,612.280,614.080,"It’s like Tulsa and Fort worth."
f000169,614.080,617.120,"So the question is, is this really a party issue?"
f000170,617.120,631.440,"I think as a party issue, you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what’s going on in Chicago where a 53 people were shot and eight died shot, if you look at New York where it’s going up, like nobody’s ever seen anything."
f000171,631.440,644.920,"The numbers are going up a 100%, 150%, 200% crime, it is crazy what’s going on and he doesn’t want to say law and order because he can’t because he’ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it’s over with."
f000172,644.920,654.840,"But if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have by the way our suburbs would be gone."
f000173,654.840,656.760,"And you would see problems like you’ve never seen before."
f000174,656.760,659.120,"He wouldn’t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn."
f000175,659.120,661.720,"Oh, I know suburbs so much that you."
f000176,661.720,662.440,"Gentlemen wait a minute."
f000177,662.440,664.120,"I was raised in the suburbs."
f000178,664.120,665.840,"This is not 1950."
f000179,665.840,668.800,"All these dog whistles and racism don’t work anymore."
f000180,668.800,670.960,"Suburbs are by and large integrated."
f000181,670.960,685.520,"There’s many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID."
f000182,685.520,686.800,"They’re dying in the suburbs."
f000183,686.800,693.360,"His failure to deal with the environment, they’re being flooded, they’re being burned out because his refusal to do anything."
f000184,693.360,695.200,"That’s why the suburbs are in trouble."
f000185,695.200,697.680,"I do want to talk about this issue of law and order though."
f000186,697.680,707.840,"And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders task force, you talked about quote re-imagining policing."
f000187,707.840,712.920,"First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support?"
f000188,712.920,726.320,"If I might finish the question, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support the Black Lives Matter call for community control of policing?"
f000189,726.320,736.640,"Look, what I support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I’m totally opposed to defunding the police offices."
f000190,736.640,744.680,"As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance."
f000191,744.680,746.080,"They need more assistance."
f000192,746.080,755.640,"They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down."
f000193,755.640,761.840,"We have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities."
f000194,761.840,764.920,"That’s when crime went down, it didn’t go up."
f000195,764.920,765.840,"It went down."

f000197,767.280,769.120,"That’s not what they are talking about this."
f000198,769.120,770.160,"That’s not what it is about."
f000199,770.160,772.520,"He’s talking about defunding the police."
f000200,772.520,773.240,"That is not true."
f000201,773.240,775.840,"He doesn’t have any law support."
f000202,775.840,777.240,"He has no law enforcement."
f000203,777.240,777.880,"That’s not true."
f000204,777.880,779.240,"He has almost nothing."
f000205,779.240,784.720,"Oh, really, who do you have name one group that supports you name one group that came out and supported you."
f000206,784.720,785.440,"Go ahead."
f000207,785.440,786.880,"Think we have time."
f000208,786.880,787.920,"We don’t have time to do anything."
f000209,787.920,789.480,"No, no think right now."
f000210,789.480,794.240,"Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you."
f000211,794.240,795.120,"Now, gentleman."
f000212,795.120,797.440,"I think I’m going to tell I’m going to take back the bottom line."
f000213,797.440,797.640,"There aren’t any."
f000214,797.640,811.680,"And I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent in Portland, Oregon, especially we had more than a 100 straight days of protests, which I think you would agree, you talk about peaceful protests."
f000215,811.680,813.920,"Many of those turned into riots."
f000216,813.920,814.240,"Mr."
f000217,814.240,820.800,"Vice-president you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable."
f000218,820.800,842.040,"The question I have though is as the democratic nominee, and earlier tonight, you said that you are the Democratic Party right now, have you ever called the Democratic Mayor of Portland or the Democratic Governor of Oregon and said, “Hey, you got to stop this, bring in the National Guard, do whatever it takes, but you’d stop the days and months of violence in Portland.”"
f000219,842.040,844.240,"I don’t hold public office."
f000220,844.240,847.120,"Now I am a former vice president."
f000221,847.120,848.320,"I’ve made it clear."
f000222,848.320,852.680,"I’ve made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted."
f000223,852.680,856.200,"It should be prosecuted and anyone who committed it should be prosecuted."
f000224,856.200,857.600,"But you’ve never called for the people…"
f000225,857.600,858.280,"He’s never done that."
f000226,858.280,859.200,"Excuse me, sir."
f000227,859.200,867.920,"You had never called for the leaders in Portland and in Oregon to call and bring in the National Guard and knock off a 100 days of riots."
f000228,867.920,872.760,"They can in fact take care of it if he just stay out of the way."
f000229,872.760,873.400,"Oh really?"
f000230,873.400,883.000,"I sent in the US Marshalls to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him for three days Portland didn’t do anything."
f000231,883.000,885.640,"I sent in the US Marshals they took care of business."
f000232,885.640,886.320,"Go ahead sir."
f000233,886.320,895.240,"And by the way his own former spokesperson said, “Riots and chaos and violence help he cause.” That’s what this is all about."
f000234,895.240,896.160,"I don’t know who said that."
f000235,896.160,897.080,"I do."
f000236,897.080,897.760,"Who?"
f000237,897.760,900.400,"I think Kellyanne Conway."
f000238,900.400,901.240,"I don’t think she said that."
f000239,901.240,901.800,"She said that."
f000240,901.800,903.120,"I don’t think so."
f000241,903.120,908.480,"Here’s the point, the point is that that’s why he keeps trying to rile everything up."
f000242,908.480,915.240,"He doesn’t want to calm things down instead of going in and talking to people and saying, “Let’s get everybody together."
f000243,915.240,917.760,"Figure out how to deal with this.” What’s he do?"
f000244,917.760,922.800,"He just pours gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary time."
f000245,922.800,923.080,"Okay."
f000246,923.080,926.920,"And to end this, button up this segment I’m going to give you a minute to answer, sir."
f000247,926.920,928.120,"You have repeatedly criticized…"
f000248,928.120,929.640,"Does it mean I have to answer his stuff."
f000249,929.640,929.840,"You have repeatedly…"
f000250,929.840,932.440,"Wait a second, you have made a statement."
f000251,932.440,933.800,"You’ve been talking back and forth."
f000252,933.800,934.400,"I’m asking you."
f000253,934.400,936.080,"I would love to end it."
f000254,936.080,940.520,"You know sir if you want to switch seats we could very quickly can do that."
f000255,940.520,942.240,"I’ll send in the National Guard, it would be over."
f000256,942.240,943.640,"That’d be no problem."
f000257,943.640,945.600,"But I don’t want to accept the National Guard."
f000258,945.600,954.200,"You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left wing extremist groups."
f000259,954.200,969.440,"But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia group and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland."
f000260,969.440,970.840,"Sure, I’m will to do that."
f000261,970.840,972.800,"Are you prepared specifically to do it."
f000262,972.800,976.760,"I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing not from the right wing."
f000263,976.760,977.280,"But what are you saying?"
f000264,977.280,978.600,"I’m willing to do anything."
f000265,978.600,979.800,"I want to see peace."
f000266,979.800,981.200,"Well, do it, sir."
f000267,981.200,982.760,"Say it, do it say it."
f000268,982.760,985.720,"What do you want to call them?"
f000269,985.720,988.880,"Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who do you want me to condemn."
f000270,988.880,989.920,"White supremacist and right-wing militia."
f000271,989.920,993.160,"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by."
f000272,993.160,1002.200,"But I’ll tell you what somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left wing."
f000273,1002.200,1006.920,"He’s own FBI Director said unlike white supremacist, Antifa is an idea not an organization-"
f000274,1006.920,1008.320,"Oh you got to be kidding me."
f000275,1008.320,1009.120,"… not a militia."
f000276,1009.120,1012.000,"That’s what his FBI Director said."
f000277,1012.000,1014.920,"Well, then you know what, he’s wrong."
f000278,1014.920,1015.840,"We’re done, sir."
f000279,1015.840,1018.000,"Moving onto the next… [crosstalk 00:42:46]"
f000280,1018.000,1019.360,"Antifa is bad."
f000281,1019.360,1023.440,"Every body in your administration tells you the true, it’s a bad idea."
f000282,1023.440,1025.040,"You have no idea about anything."
f000283,1025.040,1027.880,"You know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group."
f000284,1027.880,1031.400,"All right, gentlemen we’re now moving onto the Trump-Biden record."
f000285,1031.400,1033.400,"And you ought to be careful of them, they’ll over throw you."
f000286,1033.400,1034.280,"I’m going to ask a question."
f000287,1034.280,1048.520,"When the president seeks a second term, it is generally a referendum on his record but vice president Biden, you’d like to quote one of your dad’s sayings, which is don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative."
f000288,1048.520,1051.120,"And in this case sir you are the alternative."
f000289,1051.120,1055.400,"Looking at both of your records, I’m going to ask each of you."
f000290,1055.400,1062.800,"Why should voters elect you president over your opponent in this segment, President Trump you’ll go first, two minutes."
f000291,1062.800,1071.680,"Because there is never been an administration or president who has done more than I’ve done in a period of three and a half years."
f000292,1071.680,1078.720,"And that’s despite the impeachment hoax and you so what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job."
f000293,1078.720,1088.200,"But despite going through all of these things where I had a fight, both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that’s done what I’ve done."
f000294,1088.200,1094.640,"The greatest, before COVID came in the greatest economy in history, lowest unemployment numbers, everything was good."
f000295,1094.640,1095.720,"Everything was going."
f000296,1095.720,1098.320,"And by the way, there was unity going to happen."
f000297,1098.320,1104.520,"People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling and they were saying it’s time maybe and then what happened?"
f000298,1104.520,1105.160,"We got hit."
f000299,1105.160,1106.960,"But now we’re building it back up again."
f000300,1106.960,1111.160,"A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things."
f000301,1111.160,1119.880,"A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him, 308,000 people died because they didn’t have proper health care."
f000302,1119.880,1120.920,"It was a mess."
f000303,1120.920,1125.520,"And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets."
f000304,1125.520,1126.480,"We take care of our vets."
f000305,1126.480,1128.560,"But we’ve rebuilt our military."
f000306,1128.560,1157.400,"And I’ll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term I’ll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300 and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons I’ll have so many judges because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill."
f000307,1157.400,1160.360,"When you leave office, you don’t leave any judges."
f000308,1160.360,1161.880,"That’s like, you just don’t do that."
f000309,1161.880,1175.720,"They left 128 openings and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I’d say, if you left us 128 openings you can’t be a good president."
f000310,1175.720,1182.120,"You can’t be a good vice president but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it’ll probably be above that number."
f000311,1182.120,1185.360,"By the end of this term, 300 judges."
f000312,1185.360,1186.120,"It’s a record."
f000313,1186.120,1188.200,"Looking at both of your records."
f000314,1188.200,1194.200,"Why should voters elect you President as opposed to president Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted."
f000315,1194.200,1201.280,"Under this president, we become weaker, sicker, poor, more divided and more violent."
f000316,1201.280,1206.120,"When I was vice president, we inherited a recession."
f000317,1206.120,1207.600,"I was asked to fix it."
f000318,1207.600,1208.240,"I did."
f000319,1208.240,1212.000,"We left him a booming economy and he caused the recession."
f000320,1212.000,1220.320,"With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I’ve gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we’re not going to take any of his stuff."
f000321,1220.320,1221.520,"He’s Putin’s puppy."
f000322,1221.520,1226.880,"He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers."
f000323,1226.880,1229.120,"You son got three and a half million dollars."
f000324,1229.120,1231.760,"By the way, my son…"
f000325,1231.760,1232.200,"Wait a minute."
f000326,1232.200,1239.040,"Mr. President, your campaign agreed to both sides would get two minute answers, uninterrupted."
f000327,1239.040,1245.160,"Well, you’re a side agreed to it and why don’t you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule."
f000328,1245.160,1246.240,"Okay, sir?"
f000329,1246.240,1247.200,"He never keeps his word."
f000330,1247.200,1249.920,"No, that was a rhetorical question."
f000331,1249.920,1251.680,"Can you get back 30 seconds?"
f000332,1251.680,1252.160,"Yes."
f000333,1252.160,1254.120,"You may have, go ahead."
f000334,1254.120,1256.440,"So thirdly, we’re poor."
f000335,1256.440,1264.680,"The billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over $3- $400 billion more just since COVID."
f000336,1264.680,1269.720,"You in the home, you got less you’re in more trouble than you were before."
f000337,1269.720,1272.520,"In terms of being more violent."
f000338,1272.520,1277.640,"When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today."
f000339,1277.640,1279.760,"He’s President United States."
f000340,1279.760,1281.360,"It’s on his watch."
f000341,1281.360,1285.680,"And with regard to more divided the nation, it can’t stay divided."
f000342,1285.680,1286.600,"We can’t be this way."
f000343,1286.600,1295.880,"And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers."
f000344,1295.880,1298.680,"My son was in Iraq."
f000345,1298.680,1301.560,"He spent a year there."
f000346,1301.560,1303.240,"He got the Brown Star."
f000347,1303.240,1305.120,"He got the Conspicuous Service Medal."
f000348,1305.120,1306.760,"He was not a loser."
f000349,1306.760,1310.640,"He was a Patriot and the people left behind there were heroes."
f000350,1310.640,1310.760,"Really?"
f000351,1310.760,1311.600,"And I resent-"
f000352,1311.600,1314.000,"Are you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter."
f000353,1314.000,1317.400,"I’m talking about my son, Beau Biden, you’re talking about Hunter?"
f000354,1317.400,1318.480,"I don’t know Beau."
f000355,1318.480,1319.360,"I know Hunter."
f000356,1319.360,1321.320,"Hunter got thrown out of the military."
f000357,1321.320,1324.080,"He was thrown out dishonorably discharged."
f000358,1324.080,1326.000,"That’s not true he was not dishonorably discharged."
f000359,1326.000,1326.680,"For cocaine use."
f000360,1326.680,1329.040,"And he didn’t have a job until you became vice president."
f000361,1329.040,1329.520,"None of that is true."
f000362,1329.520,1336.440,"Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places."
f000363,1336.440,1337.880,"That is not true."
f000364,1337.880,1340.320,"He made a fortune and he didn’t have a job."
f000365,1340.320,1344.760,"My son like a lot of people at home had a drug problem."
f000366,1344.760,1346.360,"He’s overtaking it."
f000367,1346.360,1347.680,"He’s fixed it."
f000368,1347.680,1348.680,"He’s worked on it."
f000369,1348.680,1352.280,"And I’m proud of him, I’m proud of my son."
f000370,1352.280,1355.720,"But why was he given tens of millions of dollars?"
f000371,1355.720,1357.960,"He wasn’t given tens of millions of dollars."
f000372,1357.960,1359.200,"[crosstalk 00:48:23] It was all discredited."
f000373,1359.200,1361.280,"We’ve already been through this."
f000374,1361.280,1365.480,"I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects."
f000375,1365.480,1368.080,"Well, as the moderator, sir, I’m going to make a judgment call here."
f000376,1368.080,1372.280,"I know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the Mayor of Moscow."
f000377,1372.280,1373.720,"That is not true."
f000378,1373.720,1376.040,"That report is totally discredited."
f000379,1376.040,1376.320,"Why did he get it?"
f000380,1376.320,1380.080,"Mitt Romney on that committee said it wasn’t worth taxpayer’s money."
f000381,1380.080,1382.120,"That report was written for political reason."
f000382,1382.120,1384.200,"I’d like to talk about climate change."
f000383,1384.200,1384.920,"So would I."
f000384,1384.920,1385.680,"Okay."
f000385,1385.680,1388.760,"The forest fires in the West are raging now."
f000386,1388.760,1390.840,"They have burned millions of acres."
f000387,1390.840,1395.120,"They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people."
f000388,1395.120,1398.440,"When state officials there blamed the fires on climate change."
f000389,1398.440,1402.200,"Mr. President, you said, I don’t think the science knows."
f000390,1402.200,1407.400,"Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord."
f000391,1407.400,1419.440,"You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about the science of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?"
f000392,1419.440,1422.760,"I want crystal clean water and air."
f000393,1422.760,1424.560,"I want beautiful clean air."
f000394,1424.560,1430.640,"We have now the lowest carbon… If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally."
f000395,1430.640,1432.880,"But I haven’t destroyed our businesses."
f000396,1432.880,1435.440,"Our businesses aren’t put out of commission."
f000397,1435.440,1439.760,"If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint."
f000398,1439.760,1444.680,"And people are actually very happy about what’s going on because our businesses are doing well."
f000399,1444.680,1447.760,"As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management."
f000400,1447.760,1456.920,"In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they’re like tinder and leaves and everything else."
f000401,1456.920,1459.640,"You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down."
f000402,1459.640,1461.520,"You’ve got to have forest management."
f000403,1461.520,1465.800,"What do you believe about the science of climate change, sir?"
f000404,1465.800,1472.800,"I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air immaculate water and do whatever else we can that’s good."
f000405,1472.800,1478.400,"We’re planting a billion trees, the Billion Tree Project and it’s very exciting for a lot of people."
f000406,1478.400,1484.400,"You believe that human pollution, gas, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet."
f000407,1484.400,1486.880,"I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes."
f000408,1486.880,1491.600,"I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest."
f000409,1491.600,1494.120,"Every year I get the call."
f000410,1494.120,1497.000,"California’s burning, California’s burning."
f000411,1497.000,1504.920,"If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn’t be getting those calls."
f000412,1504.920,1507.080,"In Europe, they live they’re forest cities."
f000413,1507.080,1508.400,"They call forest cities."
f000414,1508.400,1509.920,"They maintain their forest."
f000415,1509.920,1511.200,"They manage their forest."
f000416,1511.200,1515.680,"I was with the head of a major country, it’s a forest city."
f000417,1515.680,1522.280,"He said, “Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California."
f000418,1522.280,1525.480,"There shouldn’t be that problem.” I spoke with the Governor about it."
f000419,1525.480,1526.880,"I’m getting along very well with the governor."
f000420,1526.880,1536.880,"But I said, “At some point you can’t every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.” That’s burning down because of a lack of management."
f000421,1536.880,1546.880,"But sir if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan which limited carbon emissions and power plants?"
f000422,1546.880,1547.880,"Why have you relaxed…?"
f000423,1547.880,1550.760,"Because it was driving energy prices through the sky."
f000424,1550.760,1555.920,"Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks?"
f000425,1555.920,1563.760,"Well, not really because what’s happening is the car is much less expensive and it’s a much safer car and you talk it about a tiny difference."
f000426,1563.760,1570.840,"And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased."
f000427,1570.840,1574.040,"We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old."
f000428,1574.040,1576.240,"If you did that, the car would be safer."
f000429,1576.240,1577.960,"It would be much cheaper by $3,500."
f000430,1577.960,1579.680,"But in the case of California they have simply ignored that."
f000431,1579.680,1584.240,"No, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car."
f000432,1584.240,1587.920,"Now, by the way, we’re going to see how that turns out."
f000433,1587.920,1589.920,"But a lot of people agree with me, many people."
f000434,1589.920,1596.080,"The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline."
f000435,1596.080,1598.160,"And I’m okay with electric cars too."
f000436,1598.160,1600.160,"I think I’m all for electric cars."
f000437,1600.160,1606.440,"I’ve given big incentives for electric cars but what they’ve done in California is just crazy."
f000438,1606.440,1608.240,"All right, Vice president Biden."
f000439,1608.240,1615.240,"I’d like you to respond to the president’s climate change record but I also want to ask you about a concern."
f000440,1615.240,1618.560,"You propose $2 trillion in green jobs."
f000441,1618.560,1622.480,"You talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking."
f000442,1622.480,1630.560,"Ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035 and zero none admission of greenhouse gases by 2050."
f000443,1630.560,1636.120,"The president says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs."
f000444,1636.120,1638.080,"He’s absolutely wrong, number one."
f000445,1638.080,1651.600,"Number two, if in fact, during our administration in the recovery act, I was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than are as cheap as coal and gas and oil."
f000446,1651.600,1656.160,"Nobody’s going to build another coal fired plant in America."
f000447,1656.160,1658.840,"No one’s going to build another oil fire plant in America."
f000448,1658.840,1660.840,"They’re going to move to renewable energy."
f000449,1660.840,1670.200,"Number one, number two, we’re going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that’s run on their electric vehicles."
f000450,1670.200,1677.360,"Making sure that we can do that, we’re going to put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we’re going to be building in the future."
f000451,1677.360,1692.160,"We’re going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability of us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they’ll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out."
f000452,1692.160,1693.800,"There’s so many things that we can do…"
f000453,1693.800,1694.960,"Gas and oil because the heat will not be going out."
f000454,1694.960,1700.480,"There’s so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs."
f000455,1700.480,1706.520,"We can get to net zero, in terms of energy production, by 2035."
f000456,1706.520,1712.240,"Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs, creating millions of good-paying jobs."
f000457,1712.240,1719.840,"Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green."
f000458,1719.840,1723.600,"And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord."
f000459,1723.600,1727.160,"I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what’s happening."
f000460,1727.160,1728.920,"It’s all falling apart."
f000461,1728.920,1734.240,"And talk about someone who has no relationship with foreign policy."
f000462,1734.240,1739.640,"The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down."
f000463,1739.640,1745.160,"More carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that’s emitted in the United States."
f000464,1745.160,1756.760,"Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, “Here’s $20 billion."
f000465,1756.760,1758.760,"Stop tearing down the forest."
f000466,1758.760,1763.360,"And If you don’t, then you’re going to have significant economic consequences.”"
f000467,1763.360,1771.120,"What about the argument that President Trump basically says, that you have to balance environmental interests and economic interests?"
f000468,1771.120,1772.880,"And he’s drawn his line."
f000469,1772.880,1775.680,"Well, he hasn’t drawn a line."
f000470,1775.680,1779.440,"He wants to make sure that methane’s not a problem."
f000471,1779.440,1782.240,"You can now emit more methane without it being a problem."
f000472,1782.240,1782.880,"Methane."
f000473,1782.880,1788.240,"This is a guy who says that you don’t have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now."
f000474,1788.240,1790.960,"This is the guy who says that, the fact that-"
f000475,1790.960,1791.400,"Not true."
f000476,1791.400,1791.760,"Not true-"
f000477,1791.760,1792.920,"It’s all true."
f000478,1792.920,1793.360,"And here’s the deal-"
f000479,1793.360,1795.600,"He’s talking about the Green New Deal."
f000480,1795.600,1798.640,"And it’s not 2 billion [crosstalk 00:55:45] or 20 billion, as you said [crosstalk 00:55:46]."
f000481,1798.640,1801.040,"It’s $100 trillion."
f000482,1801.040,1803.120,"I’m talking about the Biden plan [crosstalk 00:55:51]-"
f000483,1803.120,1805.560,"Let him go for a minute, and then you can go."
f000484,1805.560,1806.520,"And rebuild the building."
f000485,1806.520,1806.920,"No."
f000486,1806.920,1807.960,"It’s the dumbest-"
f000487,1807.960,1808.920,"That is not-"
f000488,1808.920,1811.880,"… most ridiculous [crosstalk 00:55:56] where two car systems are out-"
f000489,1811.880,1812.040,"Not true-"
f000490,1812.040,1815.760,"… where they want to take out the cows too."
f000491,1815.760,1816.760,"Not true."
f000492,1816.760,1819.280,"That’s not true either, right?"
f000493,1819.280,1820.080,"Not true."
f000494,1820.080,1821.120,"This is a 100 trillion-"
f000495,1821.120,1821.720,"Simply… Look-"
f000496,1821.720,1825.880,"That’s more money than our country could make in 100 years [crosstalk 00:02:10]-"
f000497,1825.880,1827.200,"That is simply not the case-"
f000498,1827.200,1827.680,"All right."
f000499,1827.680,1827.960,"Let me [crosstalk 00:02:12]."
f000500,1827.960,1829.040,"Wait a minute, sir."
f000501,1829.040,1840.320,"I actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes."
f000502,1840.320,1850.400,"So the question becomes, the president is saying, I think some people who support the president would say, that sounds like it’s going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy."
f000503,1850.400,1853.520,"What it’s going to do, it’s going to create thousands and millions of jobs."
f000504,1853.520,1854.600,"Good paying jobs [crosstalk 00:02:41]."
f000505,1854.600,1855.520,"Let him finish, sir."
f000506,1855.520,1856.760,"He doesn’t know how to do that-"
f000507,1856.760,1858.440,"100 million dollars."
f000508,1858.440,1866.200,"The fact is, it’s going to create millions of good paying jobs, and these tax incentives for people to weatherize, which he wants to get rid of."
f000509,1866.200,1869.240,"It’s going to make the economy much safer."
f000510,1869.240,1874.640,"Look how much we’re paying now to deal with the hurricanes, deal with… By the way, he has an answer for hurricanes."
f000511,1874.640,1877.120,"He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may-"
f000512,1877.120,1878.480,"I never said that at all-"
f000513,1878.480,1879.280,"Yeah, he did say that-"
f000514,1879.280,1879.800,"They made it up."
f000515,1879.800,1881.480,"And here’s the deal-"
f000516,1881.480,1881.880,"You make up a lot-"
f000517,1881.880,1893.160,"… we’re going to be in a position where we can create hard, hard, good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape."
f000518,1893.160,1900.240,"We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes, rising seas."
f000519,1900.240,1901.600,"We’re in real trouble."
f000520,1901.600,1908.640,"Look what’s happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa."
f000521,1908.640,1910.280,"They didn’t happen before."
f000522,1910.280,1912.360,"They’re because of global warming."
f000523,1912.360,1915.640,"We make up 15% of the world’s problem."
f000524,1915.640,1919.800,"But the rest of the world, we’ve got to get them to come along."
f000525,1919.800,1921.560,"That’s why we have to get back into the Paris Accord."
f000526,1921.560,1922.760,"All right, gentlemen-"
f000527,1922.760,1923.920,"Wait a minute, Chris."
f000528,1923.920,1926.240,"So why didn’t he do it for 47 years?"
f000529,1926.240,1927.120,"You were vice president-"
f000530,1927.120,1927.960,"For 47-"
f000531,1927.960,1932.320,"So why didn’t you get the world… China sends up real dirt into the air."
f000532,1932.320,1933.200,"Russia does."
f000533,1933.200,1933.880,"India does."
f000534,1933.880,1934.520,"They all do."
f000535,1934.520,1935.920,"We’re supposed to be good."
f000536,1935.920,1938.320,"And by the way, he made a couple of statements."
f000537,1938.320,1941.280,"The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion dollars."
f000538,1941.280,1942.440,"That is not my plan [crosstalk 00:58:10]."
f000539,1942.440,1946.000,"The Green New Deal [crosstalk 00:58:14] is not my plan."
f000540,1946.000,1946.000,"[crosstalk 00:58:15]-"
f000541,1946.000,1947.840,"Gentlemen-"
f000542,1947.840,1950.320,"He made a statement about the military."
f000543,1950.320,1952.400,"He said I said something about the military."
f000544,1952.400,1955.280,"He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it."
f000545,1955.280,1956.160,"I never said it."
f000546,1956.160,1956.720,"Okay."
f000547,1956.720,1958.720,"[crosstalk 00:58:24] Mr. Vice President-"
f000548,1958.720,1961.680,"He called the military stupid bastards."
f000549,1961.680,1963.360,"I did not say that-"
f000550,1963.360,1964.800,"He said it on tape."
f000551,1964.800,1964.800,"[crosstalk 00:58:32]-"
f000552,1964.800,1966.200,"Please, sir."
f000553,1966.200,1966.400,"[crosstalk 00:58:33] Stop."
f000554,1966.400,1968.360,"I would never say that [crosstalk 00:58:35]-"
f000555,1968.360,1968.640,"Play it."
f000556,1968.640,1969.040,"Play it-"
f000557,1969.040,1969.040,"Stop."
f000558,1969.040,1969.880,"Go ahead-"
f000559,1969.880,1971.200,"You’re on tape-"
f000560,1971.200,1974.040,"Mr. Vice President answered his final question."
f000561,1974.040,1977.240,"The final question is, I can’t remember which of all his rantings [crosstalk 00:04:44]."
f000562,1977.240,1979.680,"I’m having a little trouble myself, but…"
f000563,1979.680,1980.040,"Yeah."
f000564,1980.040,1984.560,"And about the economy and about this question of what it’s going to cost."
f000565,1984.560,1985.840,"The economy-"
f000566,1985.840,1990.120,"The Green New Deal and the idea of what your environmental changes will do-"
f000567,1990.120,1994.200,"The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward."
f000568,1994.200,1998.040,"We’re not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants-"
f000569,1998.040,1999.680,"So, do you support the Green New Deal?"
f000570,1999.680,2000.480,"Pardon me?"
f000571,2000.480,2001.040,"Do you support the-"
f000572,2001.040,2002.200,"No, I don’t support the Green New Deal."
f000573,2002.200,2003.240,"Oh, you don’t?"
f000574,2003.240,2004.840,"Oh, well, that’s a big statement."
f000575,2004.840,2005.680,"I support [crosstalk 00:05:13]-"
f000576,2005.680,2008.560,"You just lost the radical left."
f000577,2008.560,2011.800,"I support [crosstalk 00:59:17] the Biden plan that I put forward."
f000578,2011.800,2012.000,"Okay."
f000579,2012.000,2016.440,"The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal."
f000580,2016.440,2020.880,"All right, gentlemen, final segment, election integrity."
f000581,2020.880,2027.480,"As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early."
f000582,2027.480,2037.600,"How confident should we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks?"
f000583,2037.600,2043.680,"Because it will not only be to election day, but also counting some mail-in ballots after election day."
f000584,2043.680,2052.280,"What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election."
f000585,2052.280,2055.200,"In this final segment, Mr. Vice President, you go first."
f000586,2055.200,2056.520,"Prepare to let people vote."
f000587,2056.520,2062.640,"They should go to iwillvote.com, decide how they’re going to vote, when they’re going to vote, and what means by which they’re going to vote."
f000588,2062.640,2073.080,"His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating."
f000589,2073.080,2074.160,"They said that."
f000590,2074.160,2081.160,"The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way."
f000591,2081.160,2085.280,"He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one."
f000592,2085.280,2094.560,"Number two, we’re going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance."
f000593,2094.560,2099.440,"The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted."
f000594,2099.440,2107.760,"And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he’s trying to scare people into thinking that it’s not going to be legitimate."
f000595,2107.760,2109.560,"Show up and vote."
f000596,2109.560,2112.640,"You will determine the outcome of this election."
f000597,2112.640,2114.440,"Vote, vote, vote."
f000598,2114.440,2117.080,"If you’re able to vote early in your state, vote early."
f000599,2117.080,2120.200,"If you’re able to vote in person, vote in person."
f000600,2120.200,2128.160,"Vote whatever way is the best way for you, because you will… He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election."
f000601,2128.160,2133.400,"And in terms of whether or not… When the votes are counted and they’re all counted, that will be accepted."
f000602,2133.400,2135.680,"If I win, that will be accepted."
f000603,2135.680,2137.040,"If I lose, that’ll be accepted."
f000604,2137.040,2141.400,"But by the way, if in fact he says, he’s not sure what he’s going to accept."
f000605,2141.400,2146.240,"Well, let me tell you something, it doesn’t matter, because if we get the votes, it’s going to be all over."
f000606,2146.240,2147.120,"He’s going to go."
f000607,2147.120,2148.480,"He can’t stay in power."
f000608,2148.480,2149.400,"It won’t happen."
f000609,2149.400,2151.440,"It won’t happen, so vote."
f000610,2151.440,2159.600,"Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years."
f000611,2159.600,2163.120,"Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies?"
f000612,2163.120,2165.880,"Mr. President, two minutes."
f000613,2165.880,2173.080,"So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won."
f000614,2173.080,2173.800,"I won that election."
f000615,2173.800,2182.360,"And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup."
f000616,2182.360,2184.920,"They came after me spying on my campaign."
f000617,2184.920,2188.000,"They started from the day I won, and even before I won."
f000618,2188.000,2192.640,"From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster."
f000619,2192.640,2195.280,"They were a disgrace to our country, and we’ve caught them."
f000620,2195.280,2196.520,"We’ve caught them all."
f000621,2196.520,2197.920,"We’ve got it all on tape."
f000622,2197.920,2198.760,"We’ve caught them all."
f000623,2198.760,2202.040,"And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn."
f000624,2202.040,2207.400,"You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office."
f000625,2207.400,2208.480,"He knew about it too."
f000626,2208.480,2210.160,"So don’t tell me about a free transition."
f000627,2210.160,2213.640,"As far as the ballots are concerned, it’s a disaster."
f000628,2213.640,2218.800,"A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay."
f000629,2218.800,2219.840,"You’re soliciting."
f000630,2219.840,2220.520,"You’re asking."
f000631,2220.520,2221.280,"They send it back."
f000632,2221.280,2222.200,"You send it back."
f000633,2222.200,2223.440,"I did that."
f000634,2223.440,2227.360,"If you have an unsolicited… They’re sending millions of ballots all over the country."
f000635,2227.360,2228.560,"There’s fraud."
f000636,2228.560,2230.160,"They found them in creeks."
f000637,2230.160,2235.600,"They found some, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket."
f000638,2235.600,2237.600,"They’re being sent all over the place."
f000639,2237.600,2240.040,"They sent two in a Democrat area."
f000640,2240.040,2241.520,"They sent out a thousand ballots."
f000641,2241.520,2242.800,"Everybody got two ballots."
f000642,2242.800,2245.680,"This is going to be a fraud like you’ve never seen."
f000643,2245.680,2247.440,"The other thing, it’s nice."
f000644,2247.440,2250.640,"On November 3rd, you’re watching, and you see who won the election."
f000645,2250.640,2254.520,"And I think we’re going to do well because people are really happy with the job we’ve done."
f000646,2254.520,2255.600,"But you know what?"
f000647,2255.600,2256.520,"We won’t know."
f000648,2256.520,2260.120,"We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over."
f000649,2260.120,2262.000,"Take a look at what happened in Manhattan."
f000650,2262.000,2264.120,"Take a look at what happened in New Jersey."
f000651,2264.120,2266.520,"Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places."
f000652,2266.520,2269.800,"They’re not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much."
f000653,2269.800,2271.520,"An election could be won or lost with that."
f000654,2271.520,2273.880,"They’re losing 30 and 40%."
f000655,2273.880,2276.600,"It’s a fraud, and it’s a shame."
f000656,2276.600,2284.160,"And can you imagine where they say, “You have to have your ballot in by November 10th.” November 10th."
f000657,2284.160,2288.760,"That’s seven days after the election, in theory, should have been announced."
f000658,2288.760,2290.400,"We have major states [crosstalk 01:03:58] with that-"
f000659,2290.400,2290.920,"Sir."
f000660,2290.920,2291.720,"… all run by Democrats-"
f000661,2291.720,2292.880,"Two minutes is two minutes."
f000662,2292.880,2294.400,"All run by Democrats."
f000663,2294.400,2295.280,"President Trump-"
f000664,2295.280,2296.480,"It’s a rigged election."
f000665,2296.480,2298.080,"You’re going to be able to continue."
f000666,2298.080,2302.360,"You have been charging for months that mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster."
f000667,2302.360,2305.680,"You say it’s rigged [crosstalk 00:01:04:11], that it’s going to lead to fraud."
f000668,2305.680,2313.680,"But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail-in voting."
f000669,2313.680,2318.880,"That was more than a quarter of all the voters that year, cast their ballots by mail."
f000670,2318.880,2324.680,"Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it?"
f000671,2324.680,2331.040,"And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any dispute?"
f000672,2331.040,2331.440,"Yeah."
f000673,2331.440,2334.720,"I think I’m counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely."
f000674,2334.720,2338.120,"I hope we don’t need them, in terms of the election itself."
f000675,2338.120,2342.200,"But for the ballots, I think so, because what’s happening is incredible."
f000676,2342.200,2346.720,"I read today where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated."
f000677,2346.720,2347.440,"They take them."
f000678,2347.440,2349.000,"We don’t like them."
f000679,2349.000,2349.960,"We don’t like them."
f000680,2349.960,2350.760,"They throw them out-"
f000681,2350.760,2351.440,"But what are you going to do about it-"
f000682,2351.440,2352.480,"… left and right."
f000683,2352.480,2354.240,"There are millions of ballots going out right now."
f000684,2354.240,2355.560,"What are you going to do-"
f000685,2355.560,2356.400,"What you do is you go and vote."
f000686,2356.400,2358.000,"You do a solicited ballot, and that’s okay-"
f000687,2358.000,2358.240,"No."
f000688,2358.240,2358.440,"No."
f000689,2358.440,2358.760,"I know your complaint [crosstalk 01:05:05]."
f000690,2358.760,2361.400,"I’m asking you about the fact that millions of people have received-"
f000691,2361.400,2362.160,"You go and vote."
f000692,2362.160,2363.480,"You go and vote-"
f000693,2363.480,2363.520,"No."
f000694,2363.520,2366.400,"But what I’m saying is [crosstalk 01:05:11], what are you going to do about the fact that millions of people-"
f000695,2366.400,2371.600,"You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you’re sending it in, they’re sending it back and you’re sending."
f000696,2371.600,2373.920,"They have mailmen with lots of it."
f000697,2373.920,2375.000,"Did you see what’s going on?"
f000698,2375.000,2377.520,"Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots."
f000699,2377.520,2379.120,"They’re being sold."
f000700,2379.120,2380.640,"They’re being dumped in rivers."
f000701,2380.640,2382.760,"This is a horrible thing for our country."
f000702,2382.760,2384.640,"There is no [crosstalk 01:05:32]… There is no evidence of that-"
f000703,2384.640,2386.920,"This is not going to end well."
f000704,2386.920,2388.400,"There is no evidence of that-"
f000705,2388.400,2389.160,"This is not going to end well-"
f000706,2389.160,2389.200,"Okay."
f000707,2389.200,2391.640,"Vice President Biden, in fact, go ahead, sir-"
f000708,2391.640,2394.360,"Five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more."
f000709,2394.360,2396.600,"Five, including two Republican states."
f000710,2396.600,2398.880,"And you don’t have to solicit the ballot."
f000711,2398.880,2399.840,"It’s sent to you."
f000712,2399.840,2401.240,"It’s sent to your home."
f000713,2401.240,2407.400,"What they’re saying is that it has to be a postmark by election day."
f000714,2407.400,2412.600,"If it doesn’t get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted."
f000715,2412.600,2414.680,"He’s just afraid of counting the votes-"
f000716,2414.680,2414.920,"You’re wrong."
f000717,2414.920,2415.960,"You’re wrong [crosstalk 01:06:04]."
f000718,2415.960,2417.880,"I love counting the votes [crosstalk 01:06:05]-"
f000719,2417.880,2419.960,"I want to continue with you on this [crosstalk 01:06:06] Vice President Biden-"
f000720,2419.960,2421.560,"Chris, he’s so wrong when he makes a statement like that-"
f000721,2421.560,2421.880,"No."
f000722,2421.880,2422.640,"Excuse me."
f000723,2422.640,2430.040,"Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically."
f000724,2430.040,2441.560,"It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity, or they missed [crosstalk 01:06:28] the deadline."
f000725,2441.560,2448.480,"So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett will settle any dispute?"
f000726,2448.480,2451.920,"I am concerned that any court would settle this, because here’s the deal."
f000727,2451.920,2458.800,"When you get a ballot and you fill it out, you’re supposed to have an affidavit."
f000728,2458.800,2462.040,"If you didn’t know, you have someone say that, this is me."
f000729,2462.040,2475.000,"You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that’s you before the ballot is thrown out, that’s sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct I."
f000730,2475.000,2480.440,"Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say it’s you."
f000731,2480.440,2481.680,"That is totally legitimate."
f000732,2481.680,2482.440,"All right."
f000733,2482.440,2483.320,"Excuse me [crosstalk 01:07:11]-"
f000734,2483.320,2483.600,"No."
f000735,2483.600,2484.000,"No."
f000736,2484.000,2484.600,"No."
f000737,2484.600,2485.320,"I have a final [crosstalk 00:13:12]."
f000738,2485.320,2487.400,"Gentlemen, I have a final question [crosstalk 01:07:14]-"
f000739,2487.400,2489.040,"You know it can’t be done."
f000740,2489.040,2491.760,"You know it can’t, and already, there’s been fraud [crosstalk 01:07:19]-"
f000741,2491.760,2496.600,"Mail service delivers [crosstalk 01:07:21] 185 million pieces of mail a day [crosstalk 01:07:24]-"
f000742,2496.600,2498.080,"We can keep talking."
f000743,2498.080,2511.360,"In eight states, [crosstalk 01:07:27] election workers are prohibited, currently by law, eight states, from even beginning to process ballots, even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them until election day."
f000744,2511.360,2521.240,"That means that it’s likely, because there’s going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is, that it could be days."
f000745,2521.240,2522.240,"It could be weeks-"
f000746,2522.240,2523.000,"Could be months-"
f000747,2523.000,2526.440,"… until we find out who the new president is."
f000748,2526.440,2527.840,"First for you, sir."
f000749,2527.840,2531.640,"Finally, for the vice president, and I hope neither of you will interrupt the other."
f000750,2531.640,2540.480,"Will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest?"
f000751,2540.480,2547.560,"And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified?"
f000752,2547.560,2548.880,"President Trump, you go first-"
f000753,2548.880,2555.680,"I’m urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully, because that’s what has to happen."
f000754,2555.680,2557.360,"I am urging them to do it."
f000755,2557.360,2559.600,"As you know, today there was a big problem."
f000756,2559.600,2561.760,"In Philadelphia, they went in to watch."
f000757,2561.760,2564.920,"They’re called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing."
f000758,2564.920,2566.240,"They were thrown out."
f000759,2566.240,2567.560,"They weren’t allowed to watch."
f000760,2567.560,2568.320,"You know why?"
f000761,2568.320,2570.920,"Because bad things happen in Philadelphia."
f000762,2570.920,2571.360,"Bad things."
f000763,2571.360,2572.840,"And I am urging my people."
f000764,2572.840,2575.240,"I hope it’s going to be a fair election."
f000765,2575.240,2576.240,"If it’s a fair election-"
f000766,2576.240,2577.480,"You’re urging them what?"
f000767,2577.480,2579.360,"… I am 100% on board."
f000768,2579.360,2585.080,"But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can’t go along with that."
f000769,2585.080,2585.600,"And I’ll tell you why-"
f000770,2585.600,2586.440,"What does that mean, not go along-"
f000771,2586.440,2587.120,"… from a common sense-"
f000772,2587.120,2588.160,"Does that mean you’re going to tell your people-"
f000773,2588.160,2588.600,"I’ll tell you what it means-"
f000774,2588.600,2589.080,"… to take to the streets?"
f000775,2589.080,2590.640,"It means you have a fraudulent election."
f000776,2590.640,2592.040,"You’re sending out 80 million ballots-"
f000777,2592.040,2593.200,"And what would you do about that?"
f000778,2593.200,2596.800,"They’re not equipped… These people aren’t equipped to handle it, number one."
f000779,2596.800,2598.320,"Number two, they cheat."
f000780,2598.320,2599.560,"They cheat."
f000781,2599.560,2606.480,"Hey, they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots."
f000782,2606.480,2607.160,"There were military."
f000783,2607.160,2609.400,"They all had the name Trump on them."
f000784,2609.400,2610.320,"Vice President Biden-"
f000785,2610.320,2610.880,"You think that’s good?"
f000786,2610.880,2612.640,"Vice President Biden, final question for you."
f000787,2612.640,2617.080,"Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted?"
f000788,2617.080,2622.280,"And will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?"
f000789,2622.280,2622.800,"Yes."
f000790,2622.800,2623.760,"And here’s the deal."
f000791,2623.760,2626.320,"We count the ballots, as you pointed out."
f000792,2626.320,2631.040,"Some of these ballots in some states can’t even be opened until election day."
f000793,2631.040,2633.960,"And if there’s thousands of ballots, it’s going to take time to do it."
f000794,2633.960,2641.240,"And by the way, our military… They’ve been voting by ballots since the end of the Civil War, in effect."
f000795,2641.240,2643.240,"And that’s what’s going to happen."
f000796,2643.240,2647.720,"Why is it, for them, somehow not fraudulent."
f000797,2647.720,2649.600,"It’s the same process."
f000798,2649.600,2650.840,"It’s honest."
f000799,2650.840,2659.760,"No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that somehow it’s a fraudulent process."
f000800,2659.760,2661.280,"It’s already been established."
f000801,2661.280,2663.040,"Take a look at Carolyn Maloney’s race-"
f000802,2663.040,2664.200,"I asked you."
f000803,2664.200,2665.240,"You had an opportunity to respond [crosstalk 01:10:13]."
f000804,2665.240,2665.800,"Go ahead [crosstalk 01:10:14]."
f000805,2665.800,2667.960,"Vice President Biden, go ahead."
f000806,2667.960,2669.760,"He has no idea what he’s talking about."
f000807,2669.760,2670.360,"Here’s the deal."
f000808,2670.360,2672.960,"The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too."
f000809,2672.960,2673.520,"You know why?"
f000810,2673.520,2680.840,"Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that’ll be the end of it."
f000811,2680.840,2682.160,"That’ll be the end of it."
f000812,2682.160,2684.600,"And if it’s me, in fact, fine."
f000813,2684.600,2687.240,"If it’s not me, I’ll support the outcome."
f000814,2687.240,2690.840,"And I’ll be a president, not just for the Democrats."
f000815,2690.840,2693.120,"I’ll be a president for Democrats and Republicans."
f000816,2693.120,2694.120,"And this guy-"
f000817,2694.120,2695.560,"I want to see an honest ballot cut-"
f000818,2695.560,2698.080,"Gentlemen, just say that’s the end of it [crosstalk 01:10:45]."
f000819,2698.080,2699.240,"This is the end of this debate-"
f000820,2699.240,2700.480,"I want to see an honest ballot count."
f000821,2700.480,2701.480,"We’re going to leave it there-"
f000822,2701.480,2703.960,"And I think he does too-"
f000823,2703.960,2706.600,"… to be continued in more debates as we go on."
f000824,2706.600,2711.120,"President Trump, Vice President Biden, it’s been an interesting hour and a half."
f000825,2711.120,2716.800,"I want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in."
f000826,2716.800,2722.520,"We want to thank Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic for hosting this event."
f000827,2722.520,2731.480,"The next debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, will be one week from tomorrow, October 7th, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City."
f000828,2731.480,2738.160,"The two vice presidential nominees, Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will debate at 9:00 PM Eastern that night."
f000829,2738.160,2739.040,"We hope you watch."
f000830,2739.040,2740.360,"Until then, thank you, and good night."
f000831,2740.360,2740.840,"Thank you."
