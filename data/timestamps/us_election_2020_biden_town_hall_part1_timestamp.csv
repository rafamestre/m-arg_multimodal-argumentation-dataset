f000001,0.000,2.800,"Hey, and welcome to our town hall with Joe Biden."
f000002,2.800,4.560,"Mr. Vice President, welcome to you."
f000003,4.560,4.920,"Good to be with you."
f000004,4.920,6.800,"We’re here with a group of Pennsylvania voters."
f000005,6.800,10.600,"You can see they’re all appropriately socially distanced tonight."
f000006,10.600,20.400,"And there are a group of, some are voting for you, some have said they’re voting for president Trump, some are still undecided, and we’re going to try to take questions from as many of them as we can tonight."
f000007,20.400,20.520,"Okay."
f000008,20.520,23.480,"And we’re going to start with Nicholas Fed, and he’s from Jenkintown, Pennsylvania."
f000009,23.480,26.120,"That’s close to here, in Philadelphia."
f000010,26.120,27.840,"I know it well."
f000011,27.840,29.240,"You’re a Democrat."
f000012,29.240,30.080,"I’m a Democrat."
f000013,30.080,30.960,"Thank you, George."
f000014,30.960,40.160,"Mr. Vice President, every day, my wife and I are in disbelief at the lack of coordinated federal action on COVID-19."
f000015,40.160,44.880,"We know that your administration would follow the science."
f000016,44.880,48.040,"My question for you, it’s two parts."
f000017,48.040,59.320,"First, looking backwards to when this country first became aware of COVID-19, what would following the science have meant in terms of actual policy?"
f000018,59.320,73.120,"And then, looking forward, what would your administration do in terms of following the science with real concrete policies that haven’t been done by the current administration?"
f000019,73.120,81.200,"Well, first of all, going back, the fact is that the president was informed how dangerous this virus was."
f000020,81.200,87.280,"And all the way back in the beginning of February, I argued that we should be keeping people in China."
f000021,87.280,92.040,"And we had set up, in our administration, a pandemic office within the White House."
f000022,92.040,93.920,"There were 44 people on the ground."
f000023,93.920,105.640,"I suggested that we should be seeking, and I didn’t hold public office, I was a former Vice President, we in fact asked to have access to the source of the problem."
f000024,105.640,107.720,"And the best of our knowledge, Trump never pushed that."
f000025,107.720,111.200,"All those 44 people came home, never got replaced."
f000026,111.200,117.960,"In addition to that, I pointed out that I thought in February, I did a piece for USA Today saying, “This is a serious problem."
f000027,117.960,118.960,"Trump denied it."
f000028,118.960,120.560,"He said it wasn’t.”"
f000029,120.560,125.160,"We later learned that he knew full well how serious it was when he did an interview with George Woodward."
f000030,125.160,126.720,"I mean, excuse me, Bob Woodward."
f000031,126.720,132.960,"And at the time, he said he didn’t tell anybody because he was afraid Americans would panic."
f000032,132.960,134.520,"Americans don’t panic, he panicked."
f000033,134.520,136.960,"He didn’t say a word to anybody."
f000034,136.960,155.720,"Then I wrote a piece in March about what I thought we should be doing to take hold of this, using the… There’s an act that passed a long time ago that allows the president to go into a business and say, “Stop making this, and start making that.” And it took a long time for him to even institute that, to get ventilators and so on."
f000035,155.720,161.160,"And so, the point was he missed enormous opportunities and kept saying things that weren’t true."
f000036,161.160,164.720,"It’s going to go away by Easter, don’t worry about it."
f000037,164.720,167.880,"When the summer comes, it’s all going to go away like a miracle."
f000038,167.880,169.880,"He’s still saying those things."
f000039,169.880,173.840,"Before you go to the future, can I follow up on the, “I’m looking backwards.” just a little bit?"
f000040,173.840,185.320,"You did have an op-ed in January where you warned of the seriousness of the pandemic, but there’s no record of you calling for social distancing, limited social gatherings, mandatory mask-"
f000041,185.320,186.160,"Not back then."
f000042,186.160,186.680,"In January, February."
f000043,186.680,187.600,"Not in January, February."
f000044,187.600,188.880,"No, that’s correct, there wasn’t."
f000045,188.880,190.840,"That came at the end of March."
f000046,190.840,197.280,"And then I laid out a detailed plan relative to school openings in June and July."
f000047,197.280,202.960,"By that time, the science was becoming clearer and clearer of how this was spreading so rapidly."
f000048,202.960,205.080,"But the president kept denying that."
f000049,205.080,211.280,"If you notice, from March on, I stopped doing big meetings, I started wearing masks."
f000050,211.280,223.160,"So, it was at a time when the science was saying, and his key people, Dr. Fauci were saying, “You should be taking these precautions.” So, what we should be doing now, there should be a national standard."
f000051,223.160,228.720,"Instead of leaving this up to, remember what the president said to the governors, “Well, they’re on their own, it’s not my responsibility."
f000052,228.720,236.120,"The governors can do what they need to do, not my responsibility.” It is a presidential responsibility to lead, and he didn’t do that."
f000053,236.120,242.560,"He didn’t talk about what needed to be done because he kept worrying, in my view, about the stock market."
f000054,242.560,251.280,"He worried if he talked about how bad this could be, unless we took these precautionary actions, then in fact, the market would go down."
f000055,251.280,254.680,"And his barometer of success to the economy is the market."
f000056,254.680,266.760,"Thirdly, what we didn’t do is, the president had an opportunity to open and allow schools and businesses to stay open if they got the kind of help they needed."
f000057,266.760,270.320,"So, the Congress passed a couple of trillion dollars worth of help."
f000058,270.320,279.120,"And what happened was most of that money, a significant portion of that money went to the very wealthiest corporations in the country, didn’t get to the mom and pop stores."
f000059,279.120,283.880,"So, you had one in five, one in six minority businesses closing."
f000060,283.880,285.240,"Many of them permanently."
f000061,285.240,287.160,"People being laid off."
f000062,287.160,297.240,"And then what happened was, when the first round of money for unemployment, enhanced unemployment went by, he didn’t do anything."
f000063,297.240,298.080,"He didn’t do anything."
f000064,298.080,310.000,"And to the best of my knowledge, and I mean this sincerely, I can’t think of, I’ve been around for a lot of presidents, and you know a lot of presidents in a crisis, I don’t ever remember one never calling the House and Senate Republicans, Democrats together."
f000065,310.000,311.480,"Let’s look forward a little bit."
f000066,311.480,315.160,"You said that you would lock down the economy, only if the scientists said it was necessary."
f000067,315.160,319.960,"By the way, in the context, would I lock down the economy if science said so?"
f000068,319.960,321.680,"I said I’d follow science."
f000069,321.680,323.600,"But I don’t think there’s a need to lock down."
f000070,323.600,325.440,"Yeah, but I want to press you on that point."
f000071,325.440,332.120,"You’ve been in the Oval Office for eight years with President Obama, he would always say that only the hard to solve problems-"
f000072,332.120,332.720,"[crosstalk 00:06:15] Get there."
f000073,332.720,335.760,"What is most likely to happen is, the scientists will disagree."
f000074,335.760,338.360,"The scientists will disagree with the economist."
f000075,338.360,341.120,"So the question is, how are you going to decide this?"
f000076,341.120,342.240,"Who are you going to listen to?"
f000077,342.240,346.360,"And how can you can contain the pandemic without crushing the economy?"
f000078,346.360,350.440,"Well, you can contain the pandemic by being rational and not crush economy."
f000079,350.440,354.120,"For example, I laid out a plan, how you can open businesses."
f000080,354.120,361.920,"You can open businesses and schools, if in fact you provide them the guidance that they need, as well as the money to be able to do it."
f000081,361.920,371.000,"What’s happening now is, we know, for example, if you can open a business and you could have a sign on the door saying, “Safe to come in.” And that’s why people aren’t going anyway, when they’re open."
f000082,371.000,379.080,"And say, because you have social distancing, you have plastic barriers, when you go to the cashier, you have separators between the booths."
f000083,379.080,384.080,"You don’t have large crowds, you reduce the size, the number of people you can have in the restaurant."
f000084,384.080,389.920,"You make sure there’s testing, that’s a really critical piece that he didn’t do testing and tracing."
f000085,389.920,393.880,"And you make sure that people are equipped, going to schools."
f000086,393.880,400.240,"You know, we initially said, the government initially said, they’re going to provide masks for every student and every teacher."
f000087,400.240,406.840,"Then they said, “No, no, no, no.” FEMA said, the president or whomever said, ‘No, no, no."
f000088,406.840,411.360,"That’s not a national emergency, not a national emergency.”"
f000089,411.360,415.320,"We need more teachers in our schools to be able to open smaller pods."
f000090,415.320,417.600,"We need ventilation systems change."
f000091,417.600,420.320,"There’s a lot of things we know now, and I laid them out in some detail."
f000092,420.320,423.880,"Now again, when I say I laid them out, I’m not an office holder."
f000093,423.880,425.760,"I’m running for office."
f000094,425.760,431.320,"It’s not like I’m still Vice President, or I wasn’t a United States Senator pushing this."
f000095,431.320,436.480,"So, I don’t want to say, “I, I, I.” But we did lay out exactly what needed to be done."
f000096,436.480,440.360,"And take a look, we make up 4% of the world’s population."
f000097,440.360,442.360,"We have 20% of the world’s deaths."
f000098,442.360,447.160,"We’re in a situation where we have 210 plus thousand people dead."
f000099,447.160,448.520,"And what’s he doing?"
f000100,448.520,449.040,"Nothing."
f000101,449.040,451.080,"He’s still not wearing masks, and so on."
f000102,451.080,452.760,"We’re getting some other questions on COVID."
f000103,452.760,452.920,"Sure."
f000104,452.920,453.960,"The next one comes from Kelly Lee."
f000105,453.960,455.240,"She’s from Philadelphia."
f000106,455.240,455.560,"Thank you."
f000107,455.560,456.480,"Republican."
f000108,456.480,459.520,"Voted for Donald Trump in 2016."
f000109,459.520,459.640,"I did."
f000110,459.640,460.720,"Undecided now."
f000111,460.720,461.400,"Hey, Kelly."
f000112,461.400,462.120,"How are you?"
f000113,462.120,462.920,"Hi, Mr. Biden."
f000114,462.920,467.480,"My question is about the coronavirus vaccine, or potential."
f000115,467.480,468.080,"Yes."
f000116,468.080,473.320,"Senator Harris stated that she absolutely would not take a vaccine from President Trump."
f000117,473.320,477.800,"And of course, we all know it’s not President Trump that would create this vaccine."
f000118,477.800,482.160,"It would be doctors and scientists that presumably we all trust."
f000119,482.160,491.160,"So, my question for you is if a vaccine were approved between now and the end of the year, would you take it?"
f000120,491.160,496.320,"And if you were to become president, would you mandate that everyone has to take it?"
f000121,496.320,497.200,"Two things."
f000122,497.200,508.520,"Number one, President Trump talks about things that just aren’t accurate, about everything from vaccines, we’re going to have one right away, is it going to happen, and so on."
f000123,508.520,518.880,"The point is that, if the scientists, if the body of scientists say that this is what is ready to be done, and it’s been tested, they’ve gone through the three phases."
f000124,518.880,519.840,"Yes, I would take it."
f000125,519.840,521.600,"I’d encourage people to take it."
f000126,521.600,530.320,"But President Trump says things like, everything from this crazy stuff he’s walking away from now, inject bleach in your arm, and that’s going to work."
f000127,530.320,533.040,"I’m not being facetious, he’s actually said these things."
f000128,533.040,535.080,"And now, Regeneron is the answer."
f000129,535.080,536.240,"That’s going to cure everything."
f000130,536.240,542.440,"There’s 500,000 doses, we have more than a few million people, you know?"
f000131,542.440,551.760,"And so, if you noticed, most of the companies who are developing these vaccines are working, they’re making real progress."
f000132,551.760,555.920,"I meet with four leading scientists, at least twice a week."
f000133,555.920,561.360,"In the beginning, four times a week, giving us the detail on what kind of progress is being made."
f000134,561.360,563.240,"And right now, they do the right thing."
f000135,563.240,566.000,"When they run into a serious problem, they halt the test."
f000136,566.000,568.640,"They don’t continue until they figure out what the problem was."
f000137,568.640,569.920,"They’re not there yet."
f000138,569.920,579.440,"And the most scientists say, that it’s not likely to have a vaccine that would be available until the beginning of next year, into the spring of next year."
f000139,579.440,584.640,"And in the meantime, what I worry about is the same thing with Regeneron, which is a useful antidote."
f000140,584.640,589.280,"Not antidote, a useful tool."
f000141,589.280,595.320,"But what’s happening is there was no plan to figure out how to distribute it."
f000142,595.320,599.600,"We have 500,000 vials of it."
f000143,599.600,601.880,"Well, we don’t have all the testing equipment."
f000144,601.880,605.080,"We don’t have all the ability to get it to the people who need it."
f000145,605.080,611.920,"And what we should be doing now, and allegedly it’s happening, but I’ve not seen it yet nor the docs that I’ve talked to seen it."
f000146,611.920,615.800,"There should be a plan when we have the vaccine, how do we distribute it?"
f000147,615.800,621.000,"And once we get it, if it’s safe, if it’s effective, will you mandate its use?"
f000148,621.000,634.560,"The answer is, depending on how clear… Vaccines, they say, have a very positive impact and that you’re going to affect positively 85% of the American public."
f000149,634.560,638.640,"Or there’s others say, “This vaccine is really the key."
f000150,638.640,648.280,"This is the golden key.” It depends on the state of the nature of the vaccine when it comes out, and how it’s being distributed."
f000151,648.280,657.120,"But I would think that we should be talking about, depending on the continuation of the spread of the virus, we should be thinking about making it mandatory."
f000152,657.120,658.320,"How would you enforce that?"
f000153,658.320,659.960,"Well, you couldn’t, that’s the problem."
f000154,659.960,664.880,"Just like you can’t enforce measles, you can’t come to school unless you have a measles shot."
f000155,664.880,665.640,"You know, you can’t."
f000156,665.640,671.840,"But you can’t say, everyone has to do this, just like you can’t mandate a mask."
f000157,671.840,680.040,"But you can say, you can go to every governor and get them all in a room, all 50 of them as president and say, ” Ask people to wear the mask."
f000158,680.040,681.360,"Everybody knows.”"
f000159,681.360,681.760,"And if they don’t?"
f000160,681.760,682.240,"Fines?"
f000161,682.240,683.320,"And if they don’t, no."
f000162,683.320,683.840,"Not fine."
f000163,683.840,694.760,"Then I go to every governor, I go to every mayor, I go to every councilmen, and I go to every local official, say, “Mandate the mask.” Say, “This is what you have to do when you’re out."
f000164,694.760,702.760,"Make sure you encourage it being done.” Look, George, you and I know, and I think you do too as well, the words of a president matter."
f000165,702.760,703.560,"Absolutely."
f000166,703.560,706.560,"No matter whether they’re good, bad, or indifferent, they matter."
f000167,706.560,725.160,"And when a president doesn’t wear a mask or makes fun of folks like me, when I was wearing a mask for a long time, then people say, “Well, it mustn’t be that important.” But when a president says, “I think this is very important.” For example, I walked in here with this mask, but I have one of the N95 masks underneath it."
f000168,725.160,728.080,"I left it in my dressing room."
f000169,728.080,731.960,"Not the dresser, the room I was in before I got here."
f000170,731.960,735.760,"And so, I think it matters what we say."
f000171,735.760,747.520,"And we’re now learning that children are getting the virus, not with as serious consequences, but there’s been no studies done yet on vaccines for children."
f000172,747.520,751.720,"So, there’s a long way to go, but we can make progress in the meantime and save lives."
f000173,751.720,762.800,"And the last point I’ll make, if you listen to the head of the CDC, he stood up and he said, “You know, while we’re waiting for a vaccine.” He held up a mask."
f000174,762.800,782.480,"“You wear this mask, you’ll save more lives between now and the end of the year than if we had a vaccine.” It’s estimated by every major study done from the University of Washington to Columbia, that if in fact we wore masks, we could save, between now and the end of the year, a hundred thousand lives."
f000175,782.480,783.840,"And avoid lock downs?"
f000176,783.840,785.600,"And avoid lockdown, yes."
f000177,785.600,787.600,"You don’t have to lock down if you’re wearing the mask."
f000178,787.600,789.360,"Let’s get a question on the economy."
f000179,789.360,789.920,"Anthony Archer-"
f000180,789.920,791.320,"Thank you, I hope I answered your question."
f000181,791.320,793.840,"… from Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, it’s a suburb of Pittsburgh."
f000182,793.840,794.480,"Republican."
f000183,794.480,795.040,"I know it."
f000184,795.040,795.960,"Voted for President Trump."
f000185,795.960,797.240,"Thank you, George."
f000186,797.240,799.240,"Thank you, Mr. Vice President."
f000187,799.240,805.040,"You stated that anyone making less than $400,000 will not see one single penny of their taxes raised."
f000188,805.040,805.880,"That’s right."
f000189,805.880,809.840,"But also, state that you are going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts."
f000190,809.840,813.560,"The Trump tax cuts reduces taxes for the majority of workers."

f000196,837.240,844.680,"And by the way, if you take a look, we reduced the corporate tax rate from 35%."
f000197,844.680,849.040,"and Democrats, Republicans who were in office thought it should come down to 28%."
f000198,849.040,852.480,"He reduced it to 21%."
f000199,852.480,858.040,"You have 91 out of the Fortune 500 companies not paying a single solitary penny."
f000200,858.040,869.800,"If you raise the corporate tax back to 28%, which is a fair tax, you’d raise one trillion, three hundred billion dollars by that one act."
f000201,869.800,884.200,"If you made sure that people making over 400 grand paid what they did in the Bush administration, 39.6%, you would raise another, it goes up to let me get you the exact number here, about another 200, excuse me."

f000210,910.760,913.760,"You’re going to raise the corporate tax, you’re going to raise taxes on the wealthy."
f000211,913.760,918.080,"Is it wise to do even that when the economy is as weak as it is right now?"

f000232,997.920,1007.360,"And George, the way out, the reason why I’m so optimistic about economic recovery, more than I’ve ever been, is we have these four crises happening all at once."
f000233,1007.360,1008.880,"And one helps the other."
f000234,1008.880,1016.520,"For example, we’re going to invest a great deal of that money into infrastructure, and to a green infrastructure."
