f000001,0.000,2.480,"And welcome back to our town hall with Joe Biden."
f000002,2.480,4.200,"We’re going to get a question now from Cedric Humphrey."
f000003,4.200,6.240,"He’s a student from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania."
f000004,6.240,8.200,"Progressive Democrat."
f000005,8.200,9.240,"Don’t jump, Cedric."
f000006,9.240,10.400,"You’re look like you’re way up there."
f000007,10.400,11.120,"I’ll be okay."
f000008,11.120,12.000,"Thank you, George."
f000009,12.000,13.720,"And good evening, former Vice President Biden."
f000010,13.720,13.920,"Good evening."
f000011,13.920,14.560,"Many people believe that the true swing demographic in this election will be-"
f000012,14.560,24.320,"Many people believe that the true swing demographic in this election will be Black voters under the age of 30, not because they’ll be voting for Trump, but because they won’t vote at all."
f000013,24.320,26.880,"I myself have had this exact same conflict."
f000014,26.880,38.840,"So my question for you then is, besides “You ain’t Black,” what do you have to say to young Black voters who see voting for you as further participation in a system that continually fails to protect them?"
f000015,38.840,44.560,"Well, I’d say first of all, as my buddy John Lewis said, “It’s a sacred opportunity, the right to vote."
f000016,44.560,50.040,"You can make a difference.” If young Black women and men vote, you can determine the outcome of this election."
f000017,50.040,50.880,"Not a joke."
f000018,50.880,52.000,"You can do that."
f000019,52.000,54.560,"Then the next question is, am I worthy of your vote?"
f000020,54.560,55.880,"Can I earn your vote?"
f000021,55.880,61.760,"And the answer is, there’s two things I think that I care and I’ve demonstrated I care about my whole career."
f000022,61.760,74.160,"One is, in addition to dealing with a criminal justice system to make it fairer and make it more decent, we have to be able to put Black Americans in a position to be able to gain wealth, generate wealth."
f000023,74.160,76.520,"And so you look at what that entails."
f000024,76.520,92.200,"It entails everything from early education, that’s why I’m supporting making sure that Title One schools, as you know, schools with the least tax base to be able to support their schools, I increased the funding from them from $15 to $45 billion."
f000025,92.200,98.800,"That allows every teacher in that school to make up to 60,000 bucks, and the problem now is they’re leaving the schools."
f000026,98.800,99.640,"They’re not there."
f000027,99.640,103.680,"We’re short about a million and a half teachers, a million and a quarter teachers."
f000028,103.680,118.080,"Number two, every three and four and five-year-old will go to school, school, not daycare, school, and with all the great universities, including the one you’ve gone to, go to, or went to, in fact, talks about in the last eight years, what’s happened."
f000029,118.080,120.360,"What happens when you let them go to school?"
f000030,120.360,130.280,"They make up rapidly whatever shortcoming they had in terms of their education prior to that."
f000031,130.280,133.280,"They have not heard as many words spoken, et cetera, et cetera."
f000032,133.280,143.080,"What happens is that, the studies show, that 58% will increase by 58% their chance of going all through 12 years of school, and going through successfully."
f000033,143.080,149.200,"It will also provide for the ability to bring in social workers and school psychologists."
f000034,149.200,153.160,"We have one school psychologist in America now for every 1,507 kids."
f000035,153.160,167.960,"It should be one to 500, not just in schools that are poor, but in all schools, because we learned that, for example, drug abuse doesn’t cause mental illness, mental illness causes drug abuse, the failure to get hold of people and deal with their anxieties."
f000036,167.960,182.000,"In addition to that, I provide for a $70 billion for HBC use for them to be able to have the wherewithal to do what other universities can do, because they don’t have the kind of foundational support they need."
f000037,182.000,194.120,"And so that would allow them, for example, like we did in our administration, the President allowed me to go down and we awarded a cybersecurity laboratory, ability to compete for cybersecurity laboratory."
f000038,194.120,202.720,"The federal government spends billions of dollars a year on universities, because there are the best kept secret and where most of the major inventions come out of."
f000039,202.720,210.240,"And so that school now will be able to produce young Black women and men who are going to go into a field of the future that’s burgeoning, cybersecurity."
f000040,210.240,212.360,"And that’s what is going to help a great deal."
f000041,212.360,229.320,"In addition to that, if you’re a young man about to graduate and you graduated from school and you want to own your first home, well, it’s awful hard to get the money, depending on the background, where your economic background is, to get a down payments."
f000042,229.320,237.000,"So we’re going to guarantee first term home buyers a $15,000 down payment for first term home buyers."
f000043,237.000,247.120,"In addition to that, all the studies now show, and I’ve been arguing this for a long time, is young Black entrepreneurs are just as successful as White entrepreneurs or anyone else given a shot."
f000044,247.120,248.560,"But you can’t get the money."
f000045,248.560,250.600,"Where do you go to get the startup money?"
f000046,250.600,266.040,"So what President Obama and I did, we had a program where we took $1.5 billion and we invested it in all the SBAs around the country, and the state SBAs, small business associations, and that generated $30 billion came off the sideline."
f000047,266.040,281.120,"Because if you have a guarantee of $200,000 for your new startup enterprise, a young entrepreneur, you’re going to be able to attract, if it’s government money and it’s a guarantee, you could be able to attract another $100,000."
f000048,281.120,283.600,"It generated $30 billion."
f000049,283.600,293.880,"Well, I’m changing that program and I’ll get this done without much trouble I believe in the Congress from $1.5 million to $30 billion."
f000050,293.880,298.440,"That’ll take $300 billion off the sideline and grow."
f000051,298.440,320.480,"And, for example, if you, in fact, and I were the same age and we split our differences, if we were the same age, and we went to the same builder to buy us each the same home, but my home was in a White neighborhood on one side of a highway, and yours is in a Black neighborhood, same exact home, your home will start off being valued 29% less than my home."
f000052,320.480,323.480,"Yet your insurance for that home will be higher."
f000053,323.480,325.280,"You’ll be taxed more for it."
f000054,325.280,326.120,"We’ve got to end this."
f000055,326.120,329.280,"That’s what got me involved in politics in the first place, a thing called red lining."
f000056,329.280,336.640,"We can change so much that we can do so much to change the circumstances to give people a real opportunity."
f000057,336.640,337.200,"Cedric."
f000058,337.200,337.680,"Is that right?"
f000059,337.680,339.040,"Did you hear what you needed here?"
f000060,339.040,341.000,"I think so."
f000061,341.000,345.200,"Well, there’s a lot more if you’re going to hang around afterwards."
f000062,345.200,346.080,"I’ll tell you more."
f000063,346.080,346.880,"Okay."
f000064,346.880,349.200,"No, but I really mean it."
f000065,349.200,350.200,"It’s the key."
f000066,350.200,365.080,"Look, this is the way every other … Like my dad, he lost his job up in Scranton and it took him three years to be able to move down to Delaware, to Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town, and send us home to our grandpop to live with him."
f000067,365.080,366.320,"We finally got back."
f000068,366.320,369.680,"We lived in an apartment, which became six and eight housing much later."
f000069,369.680,371.480,"It was just normal apartments."
f000070,371.480,375.200,"But it took him five years to be able to buy a home."
f000071,375.200,380.680,"Well, we bought a three bedroom home with four kids and a grandpop living with us, but it accumulated wealth."
f000072,380.680,382.080,"You built up wealth."
f000073,382.080,384.680,"That’s how middle-class folks make it."
f000074,384.680,385.360,"They build up wealth."
f000075,385.360,389.840,"Then he was able to borrow a little against that to be able to help us get the school, those kinds of things."
f000076,389.840,395.160,"It’s about accumulating wealth and you’re behind an eight ball."
f000077,395.160,398.080,"The vast majority of people of color are behind an eight ball."
f000078,398.080,402.280,"And it’s the same way what’s going on now with all this money that’s been voted."
f000079,402.280,403.280,"What’s happened?"
f000080,403.280,411.960,"You go to the bank, if you’re a Black businessman, and the President fired the only Inspector General to see oversee all this help coming from the Congress."
f000081,411.960,413.800,"And what happens?"
f000082,413.800,423.080,"You go in and they say, “Ah, do you have an account here?” “No.” “Do you have a credit card?” “No.” “Have you borrowed from us before ?” “No.” We bailed these suckers out."
f000083,423.080,428.040,"They’re not liable for any of the money, but they still won’t lend it to you."
f000084,428.040,429.800,"We’ve got to change that."
f000085,429.800,431.520,"It’s about accumulating wealth."
f000086,431.520,434.480,"I want to get another question in here from Angelica Politarhos."
f000087,434.480,435.120,"I’m sorry."
f000088,435.120,435.680,"No, not at all."
f000089,435.680,436.520,"Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania."
f000090,436.520,437.000,"Hi."
f000091,437.000,438.760,"Republican who voted for President Trump last time."
f000092,438.760,439.400,"Thank you."
f000093,439.400,440.880,"Thank you, George."
f000094,440.880,443.040,"Thank you, Vice President Biden."
f000095,443.040,443.560,"Nice to meet you."
f000096,443.560,449.880,"What’s your view on the Crime Bill that you wrote 1994, which showed prejudice against minorities?"
f000097,449.880,451.640,"Where do you stand today on that?"
f000098,451.640,453.760,"Well, first of all, things have changed drastically."
f000099,453.760,457.000,"That Crime Bill, when it voted, the Black Caucus voted for it."
f000100,457.000,464.920,"Every Black mayor supported it across the board and the Crime Bill itself did not have mandatory sentences except for two things."
f000101,464.920,473.880,"It had three strikes and you’re out, which I voted against, in the Crime Bill, but it had a lot of other things in it that turned out to be both bad and good."
f000102,473.880,475.240,"I wrote the Violence Against Women Act."
f000103,475.240,478.880,"That was part of the assault weapons ban and other things that were good."
f000104,478.880,486.640,"What I was against was giving states more money for prison systems that they could build, state prison systems."
f000105,486.640,493.040,"And you have 93 out of every 100 people in jail now is in a state prison, not in a federal prison, because they built more prisons."
f000106,493.040,496.800,"I also wrote into that bill a thing called drug courts."
f000107,496.800,500.760,"I don’t believe anybody should be going to jail for drug use."
f000108,500.760,504.440,"They should be going into mandatory rehabilitation."
f000109,504.440,509.040,"We should be building rehab centers to have these people housed."
f000110,509.040,526.160,"We should decriminalize marijuana, wipe out the record so you can actually say honesty, “You ever been arrested for murder for anything?” You can say no, because we’re going to pass a law saying there is no background that you have to reveal relative to the use of marijuana."
f000111,526.160,527.800,"And so there’s a lot of things."
f000112,527.800,530.360,"But in addition to that, we’ve got to change the system."
f000113,530.360,539.040,"I joined with a group of people in the House to provide for changing the system from punishment to rehabilitation."
f000114,539.040,543.440,"Along with a guy named Marlon Specter, who you may remember, I wrote the Second Chance Act."
f000115,543.440,547.680,"In the meantime, an awful lot of people were jailed for minor drug crimes after the Crime Bill."
f000116,547.680,548.320,"Right."
f000117,548.320,549.960,"Was it a mistake to support it?"
f000118,549.960,550.680,"Yes, it was."
f000119,550.680,552.800,"But here’s where the mistake."
f000120,552.800,556.600,"The mistake came in terms of what the states did locally."
f000121,556.600,563.840,"What we did federally, we said, you remember, George, it was all about the same time for the same crime."
f000122,563.840,587.280,"What I had done as the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I took the 10 Circuit Courts of Appeals, took some really brilliant lawyers working for me in Judiciary, we did a study and we determined what happens if, for the first, second, third offense for any crime in the criminal justice system at the federal level, if you’re a Black man and it’s the first time you’ve committed robbery, how long would you go to jail?"
f000123,587.280,587.640,"On average?"
f000124,587.640,589.040,"If you’re White man, how long?"
f000125,589.040,592.320,"The Black man would go to jail on average 13 years."
f000126,592.320,593.840,"White man, two years."
f000127,593.840,596.640,"I’d go down the list of every single crime."
f000128,596.640,599.320,"So we set up a sentencing commission."
f000129,599.320,600.720,"We didn’t set the time."
f000130,600.720,604.040,"Every single solitary maximum was reduced in there."
f000131,604.040,607.720,"But what happened was it became the same time for the same crime."
f000132,607.720,618.560,"So it said, “You have to serve between one and three years.” And it ended up becoming much lower, Black folks went to jail a lot less than they would have before."
f000133,618.560,619.920,"But it was a mistake."
f000134,619.920,621.200,"Let me ask another follow-up on the Crime bill."
f000135,621.200,624.600,"It also funded 100,000 police back in 1994."
f000136,624.600,627.840,"You’ve often said that more cops clearly mean less crime."
f000137,627.840,629.320,"Do you still believe that?"
f000138,629.320,633.440,"Yes, if in fact they’re involved in community policing, not jump squads."
f000139,633.440,642.720,"For example, when we had community policing, from the mid-’90s on until till Bush got elected, what happened?"
f000140,642.720,646.840,"Violent crime actually went down precipitous."
f000141,646.840,651.640,"Remember the significant rise in violent crime that was occurring in the late ’80s into the ’90s."
f000142,651.640,657.160,"It went down and fewer African Americans were arrested because you had the requirement."
f000143,657.160,658.160,"The cops didn’t like it."
f000144,658.160,670.520,"They didn’t like the community policing, because you had to have two people in the vehicle, they had to get out of their cars, they had to introduce themselves to who own the local liquor store, who owned the local grocery store, who was the woman on the corner."
f000145,670.520,674.200,"And what they would do, George, they’d actually go and give people their phone numbers."
f000146,674.200,675.920,"A cop would give the phone number."
f000147,675.920,695.040,"So if Nelly Smith was on the second floor where drug deals took place and things happened below her apartment, she could call and say, “It’s Millie, and there’s something going on here.” And they’d never revealed it was her, because they’d know, if she knew that, in fact, they report, they’d never report the crime, she’d never report."
f000148,695.040,697.200,"So it actually started to come down."
f000149,697.200,698.280,"And what happened?"
f000150,698.280,701.240,"They eliminated the funding for community policing."
f000151,701.240,706.880,"Community policing doesn’t mean more people coming in, in armored Humvees and swarming."
f000152,706.880,723.000,"It turned out that by the time we got to the late ’90s and crime had come down so much, the mayors and everybody asked the question, “Where do you want me to spend the money?” They say, “Well, only 1% thought violent crime was a problem.” It was as high as 22%."
f000153,723.000,724.960,"Right now we have a systemic problem."
f000154,724.960,727.640,"How do you get the kind of policing, prevent the kind of policing [crosstalk 00:35:55]."
f000155,727.640,729.360,"You have to change the way in which they [inaudible 00:35:55]."
f000156,729.360,752.080,"One of the things I’m going to do, George, is what is set up a national study group made up of cops, social workers, as well as made up of the Black community and the Brown community to sit down in the White House and over the next year come up with significant reforms that need to take place within communities."
f000157,752.080,753.840,"You have to bring them together."
f000158,753.840,761.240,"One of the things I’ve observed is, the neighborhood I grew up, I grew up in Claymont, you either became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest."
f000159,761.240,765.640,"I wasn’t qualified much to do any one of them, but here’s the deal, all kidding aside."
f000160,765.640,768.000,"Most cops don’t like bad cops."
f000161,768.000,768.600,"Correct."
f000162,768.600,769.680,"They don’t like it."
f000163,769.680,770.280,"That’s correct."
f000164,770.280,774.080,"And so what happens is they get intimidated into not reporting."
f000165,774.080,778.040,"So one of the things we do is there has to be transparency available."
f000166,778.040,787.640,"We have to be able to go in at the federal level, be able to go in and check out whether or not there’s systematic problems within police departments."
f000167,787.640,794.920,"If, in fact, a cop needs to be tried, it’s not the prosecutor in the community, in the district there."
f000168,794.920,799.280,"You’ve got to go outside the community to get another prosecutor to come in to handle the crime."
f000169,799.280,803.800,"There’s a lot of things we’ve learned, and it takes time but we can do this."
f000170,803.800,810.840,"You can ban choke holds, but beyond that, you have to teach people how to de-escalate circumstances."
f000171,810.840,811.760,"De-escalate."
f000172,811.760,816.480,"So instead of anybody coming at you and the first thing you do is shoot to kill, you shoot them in the leg."
f000173,816.480,824.160,"There’s ways you have to do more background checks in terms of whether or not the person coming in, passes a certain psychological test."
f000174,824.160,836.200,"And the last thing I’ll say, and I’m sorry, but it’s really, I think, really, really important, is you have to be in a position where you are able to identify, identify the things that have to change."
f000175,836.200,842.800,"And one of the things that has to change is so many cops get called into circumstances where somebody is mentally off."
f000176,842.800,847.320,"Like what happened not long ago, that guy with the knife."
f000177,847.320,863.080,"That’s why we have to provide within police departments psychologists and social workers to go out with the cops on those calls, some of those 911 calls to de-escalate the circumstance, to deal with talking them down."
f000178,863.080,865.400,"But cops are kind of like school teachers now."
f000179,865.400,868.600,"A school teacher has to know everything from how to handle hunger in a household as well as how to teach how to read."
