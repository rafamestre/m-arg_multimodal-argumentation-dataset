n020208,And that went on for months.,Donald Trump,2,a020208,COVID,2
n020209,Nancy Pelosi said the same thing.,Donald Trump,2,a020209,COVID,2
n020210,"She was dancing on the streets in Chinatown, in San Francisco.",Donald Trump,2,a020210,COVID,2

n020229,Those other concerns are real.,Joe Biden,1,a020229,COVID,2
n020230,"That’s why he should have been, instead of in a sand trap at his golf course, he should have been negotiating with Nancy Pelosi and the rest of the Democrats and Republicans about what to do about the acts they were passing for billions of dollars to make sure people had the capacity.",Joe Biden,1,a020230,COVID,2
n020231,But you haven’t ruled out more shut downs?,Kristen Welker,3,a020231,COVID,2

n020236,Do not open bars and do not open gymnasiums.,Joe Biden,1,a020236,COVID,2

n020238,"For example, schools.",Joe Biden,1,a020238,COVID,2

n020240,They need to deal with ventilation systems.,Joe Biden,1,a020240,COVID,2
n020241,"They need to deal with smaller classes, more teachers, more pods, and he’s refused to support that money, or at least up to now.",Joe Biden,1,a020241,COVID,2

n020250,They’re dying.,Donald Trump,2,a020250,COVID,2
n020251,And he supports all these people.,Donald Trump,2,a020251,COVID,2

n020279,"Vice President Biden, your response.",Kristen Welker,3,a020279,COVID,2
n020280,Simply not true.,Joe Biden,1,a020280,COVID,2
n020281,We ought to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.,Joe Biden,1,a020281,COVID,2

n020284,"You need to have, if you have a restaurant, you need to have plexiglass dividers so people cannot infect one another.",Joe Biden,1,a020284,COVID,2

n040114,Yes.,Joe Biden,1,a040114,COVID,4
n040115,Senator Harris stated that she absolutely would not take a vaccine from President Trump.,Audience Member 2,6,a040115,COVID,4
n040116,"And of course, we all know it’s not President Trump that would create this vaccine.",Audience Member 2,6,a040116,COVID,4
n040117,It would be doctors and scientists that presumably we all trust.,Audience Member 2,6,a040117,COVID,4
n040118,"So, my question for you is if a vaccine were approved between now and the end of the year, would you take it?",Audience Member 2,6,a040118,COVID,4
n040119,"And if you were to become president, would you mandate that everyone has to take it?",Audience Member 2,6,a040119,COVID,4
n040120,Two things.,Joe Biden,1,a040120,COVID,4
n040121,"Number one, President Trump talks about things that just aren’t accurate, about everything from vaccines, we’re going to have one right away, is it going to happen, and so on.",Joe Biden,1,a040121,COVID,4
n040122,"The point is that, if the scientists, if the body of scientists say that this is what is ready to be done, and it’s been tested, they’ve gone through the three phases.",Joe Biden,1,a040122,COVID,4
n040123,"Yes, I would take it.",Joe Biden,1,a040123,COVID,4
n040124,I’d encourage people to take it.,Joe Biden,1,a040124,COVID,4
n040125,"But President Trump says things like, everything from this crazy stuff he’s walking away from now, inject bleach in your arm, and that’s going to work.",Joe Biden,1,a040125,COVID,4
n040126,"I’m not being facetious, he’s actually said these things.",Joe Biden,1,a040126,COVID,4
n040127,"And now, Regeneron is the answer.",Joe Biden,1,a040127,COVID,4
n040128,That’s going to cure everything.,Joe Biden,1,a040128,COVID,4
n040129,"There’s 500,000 doses, we have more than a few million people, you know?",Joe Biden,1,a040129,COVID,4
n040130,"And so, if you noticed, most of the companies who are developing these vaccines are working, they’re making real progress.",Joe Biden,1,a040130,COVID,4
n040131,"I meet with four leading scientists, at least twice a week.",Joe Biden,1,a040131,COVID,4

n040134,"When they run into a serious problem, they halt the test.",Joe Biden,1,a040134,COVID,4
n040135,They don’t continue until they figure out what the problem was.,Joe Biden,1,a040135,COVID,4
n040136,They’re not there yet.,Joe Biden,1,a040136,COVID,4
n040137,"And the most scientists say, that it’s not likely to have a vaccine that would be available until the beginning of next year, into the spring of next year.",Joe Biden,1,a040137,COVID,4
n040138,"And in the meantime, what I worry about is the same thing with Regeneron, which is a useful antidote.",Joe Biden,1,a040138,COVID,4
n040139,"Not antidote, a useful tool.",Joe Biden,1,a040139,COVID,4
n040140,But what’s happening is there was no plan to figure out how to distribute it.,Joe Biden,1,a040140,COVID,4
n040141,"We have 500,000 vials of it.",Joe Biden,1,a040141,COVID,4
n040142,"Well, we don’t have all the testing equipment.",Joe Biden,1,a040142,COVID,4
n040143,We don’t have all the ability to get it to the people who need it.,Joe Biden,1,a040143,COVID,4

n040145,"There should be a plan when we have the vaccine, how do we distribute it?",Joe Biden,1,a040145,COVID,4
n040146,"And once we get it, if it’s safe, if it’s effective, will you mandate its use?",George Stephanopoulos,4,a040146,COVID,4
n040147,"The answer is, depending on how clear… Vaccines, they say, have a very positive impact and that you’re going to affect positively 85% of the American public.",Joe Biden,1,a040147,COVID,4
n040148,"Or there’s others say, “This vaccine is really the key.",Joe Biden,1,a040148,COVID,4
n040149,"This is the golden key.” It depends on the state of the nature of the vaccine when it comes out, and how it’s being distributed.",Joe Biden,1,a040149,COVID,4
n040150,"But I would think that we should be talking about, depending on the continuation of the spread of the virus, we should be thinking about making it mandatory.",Joe Biden,1,a040150,COVID,4
n040151,How would you enforce that?,George Stephanopoulos,4,a040151,COVID,4
n040152,"Well, you couldn’t, that’s the problem.",Joe Biden,1,a040152,COVID,4

n040165,"No matter whether they’re good, bad, or indifferent, they matter.",Joe Biden,1,a040165,COVID,4
n040166,"And when a president doesn’t wear a mask or makes fun of folks like me, when I was wearing a mask for a long time, then people say, “Well, it mustn’t be that important.” But when a president says, “I think this is very important.” For example, I walked in here with this mask, but I have one of the N95 masks underneath it.",Joe Biden,1,a040166,COVID,4

n040170,"And we’re now learning that children are getting the virus, not with as serious consequences, but there’s been no studies done yet on vaccines for children.",Joe Biden,1,a040170,COVID,4
n040171,"So, there’s a long way to go, but we can make progress in the meantime and save lives.",Joe Biden,1,a040171,COVID,4
n040172,"And the last point I’ll make, if you listen to the head of the CDC, he stood up and he said, “You know, while we’re waiting for a vaccine.” He held up a mask.",Joe Biden,1,a040172,COVID,4
n040173,"“You wear this mask, you’ll save more lives between now and the end of the year than if we had a vaccine.” It’s estimated by every major study done from the University of Washington to Columbia, that if in fact we wore masks, we could save, between now and the end of the year, a hundred thousand lives.",Joe Biden,1,a040173,COVID,4

n050010,Many people believe that the true swing demographic in this election will be-,Audience Member 4,9,a050010,Racism,5
n050011,"Many people believe that the true swing demographic in this election will be Black voters under the age of 30, not because they’ll be voting for Trump, but because they won’t vote at all.",Audience Member 4,9,a050011,Racism,5
n050012,I myself have had this exact same conflict.,Audience Member 4,9,a050012,Racism,5
n050013,"So my question for you then is, besides “You ain’t Black,” what do you have to say to young Black voters who see voting for you as further participation in a system that continually fails to protect them?",Audience Member 4,9,a050013,Racism,5
n050014,"Well, I’d say first of all, as my buddy John Lewis said, “It’s a sacred opportunity, the right to vote.",Joe Biden,1,a050014,Racism,5
n050015,"You can make a difference.” If young Black women and men vote, you can determine the outcome of this election.",Joe Biden,1,a050015,Racism,5
n050016,Not a joke.,Joe Biden,1,a050016,Racism,5
n050017,You can do that.,Joe Biden,1,a050017,Racism,5
n050018,"Then the next question is, am I worthy of your vote?",Joe Biden,1,a050018,Racism,5
n050019,Can I earn your vote?,Joe Biden,1,a050019,Racism,5
n050020,"And the answer is, there’s two things I think that I care and I’ve demonstrated I care about my whole career.",Joe Biden,1,a050020,Racism,5
n050021,"One is, in addition to dealing with a criminal justice system to make it fairer and make it more decent, we have to be able to put Black Americans in a position to be able to gain wealth, generate wealth.",Joe Biden,1,a050021,Racism,5
n050022,And so you look at what that entails.,Joe Biden,1,a050022,Racism,5
n050023,"It entails everything from early education, that’s why I’m supporting making sure that Title One schools, as you know, schools with the least tax base to be able to support their schools, I increased the funding from them from $15 to $45 billion.",Joe Biden,1,a050023,Racism,5
n050024,"That allows every teacher in that school to make up to 60,000 bucks, and the problem now is they’re leaving the schools.",Joe Biden,1,a050024,Racism,5

n050031,"What happens is that, the studies show, that 58% will increase by 58% their chance of going all through 12 years of school, and going through successfully.",Joe Biden,1,a050031,Racism,5

n050035,"In addition to that, I provide for a $70 billion for HBC use for them to be able to have the wherewithal to do what other universities can do, because they don’t have the kind of foundational support they need.",Joe Biden,1,a050035,Racism,5
n050036,"And so that would allow them, for example, like we did in our administration, the President allowed me to go down and we awarded a cybersecurity laboratory, ability to compete for cybersecurity laboratory.",Joe Biden,1,a050036,Racism,5

n050040,"In addition to that, if you’re a young man about to graduate and you graduated from school and you want to own your first home, well, it’s awful hard to get the money, depending on the background, where your economic background is, to get a down payments.",Joe Biden,1,a050040,Racism,5
n050041,"So we’re going to guarantee first term home buyers a $15,000 down payment for first term home buyers.",Joe Biden,1,a050041,Racism,5
n050042,"In addition to that, all the studies now show, and I’ve been arguing this for a long time, is young Black entrepreneurs are just as successful as White entrepreneurs or anyone else given a shot.",Joe Biden,1,a050042,Racism,5
n050043,But you can’t get the money.,Joe Biden,1,a050043,Racism,5
n050044,Where do you go to get the startup money?,Joe Biden,1,a050044,Racism,5
n050045,"So what President Obama and I did, we had a program where we took $1.5 billion and we invested it in all the SBAs around the country, and the state SBAs, small business associations, and that generated $30 billion came off the sideline.",Joe Biden,1,a050045,Racism,5
n050046,"Because if you have a guarantee of $200,000 for your new startup enterprise, a young entrepreneur, you’re going to be able to attract, if it’s government money and it’s a guarantee, you could be able to attract another $100,000.",Joe Biden,1,a050046,Racism,5
n050047,It generated $30 billion.,Joe Biden,1,a050047,Racism,5
n050048,"Well, I’m changing that program and I’ll get this done without much trouble I believe in the Congress from $1.5 million to $30 billion.",Joe Biden,1,a050048,Racism,5
n050049,That’ll take $300 billion off the sideline and grow.,Joe Biden,1,a050049,Racism,5
n050050,"And, for example, if you, in fact, and I were the same age and we split our differences, if we were the same age, and we went to the same builder to buy us each the same home, but my home was in a White neighborhood on one side of a highway, and yours is in a Black neighborhood, same exact home, your home will start off being valued 29% less than my home.",Joe Biden,1,a050050,Racism,5

n050061,I’ll tell you more.,Joe Biden,1,a050061,Racism,5
n050062,Okay.,Joe Biden,1,a050062,Racism,5
n050063,"No, but I really mean it.",Joe Biden,1,a050063,Racism,5
n050064,It’s the key.,Joe Biden,1,a050064,Racism,5
n050065,"Look, this is the way every other … Like my dad, he lost his job up in Scranton and it took him three years to be able to move down to Delaware, to Claymont, Delaware, a little steel town, and send us home to our grandpop to live with him.",Joe Biden,1,a050065,Racism,5
n050066,We finally got back.,Joe Biden,1,a050066,Racism,5
n050067,"We lived in an apartment, which became six and eight housing much later.",Joe Biden,1,a050067,Racism,5
n050068,It was just normal apartments.,Joe Biden,1,a050068,Racism,5
n050069,But it took him five years to be able to buy a home.,Joe Biden,1,a050069,Racism,5
n050070,"Well, we bought a three bedroom home with four kids and a grandpop living with us, but it accumulated wealth.",Joe Biden,1,a050070,Racism,5
n050071,You built up wealth.,Joe Biden,1,a050071,Racism,5
n050072,That’s how middle-class folks make it.,Joe Biden,1,a050072,Racism,5
n050073,They build up wealth.,Joe Biden,1,a050073,Racism,5
n050074,"Then he was able to borrow a little against that to be able to help us get the school, those kinds of things.",Joe Biden,1,a050074,Racism,5
n050075,It’s about accumulating wealth and you’re behind an eight ball.,Joe Biden,1,a050075,Racism,5
n050076,The vast majority of people of color are behind an eight ball.,Joe Biden,1,a050076,Racism,5

n050078,What’s happened?,Joe Biden,1,a050078,Racism,5
n050079,"You go to the bank, if you’re a Black businessman, and the President fired the only Inspector General to see oversee all this help coming from the Congress.",Joe Biden,1,a050079,Racism,5
n050080,And what happens?,Joe Biden,1,a050080,Racism,5
n050081,"You go in and they say, “Ah, do you have an account here?” “No.” “Do you have a credit card?” “No.” “Have you borrowed from us before ?” “No.” We bailed these suckers out.",Joe Biden,1,a050081,Racism,5

n050097,"Well, first of all, things have changed drastically.",Joe Biden,1,a050097,Racism,5
n050098,"That Crime Bill, when it voted, the Black Caucus voted for it.",Joe Biden,1,a050098,Racism,5
n050099,Every Black mayor supported it across the board and the Crime Bill itself did not have mandatory sentences except for two things.,Joe Biden,1,a050099,Racism,5
n050100,"It had three strikes and you’re out, which I voted against, in the Crime Bill, but it had a lot of other things in it that turned out to be both bad and good.",Joe Biden,1,a050100,Racism,5
n050101,I wrote the Violence Against Women Act.,Joe Biden,1,a050101,Racism,5
n050102,That was part of the assault weapons ban and other things that were good.,Joe Biden,1,a050102,Racism,5
n050103,"What I was against was giving states more money for prison systems that they could build, state prison systems.",Joe Biden,1,a050103,Racism,5
n050104,"And you have 93 out of every 100 people in jail now is in a state prison, not in a federal prison, because they built more prisons.",Joe Biden,1,a050104,Racism,5
n050105,I also wrote into that bill a thing called drug courts.,Joe Biden,1,a050105,Racism,5
n050106,I don’t believe anybody should be going to jail for drug use.,Joe Biden,1,a050106,Racism,5
n050107,They should be going into mandatory rehabilitation.,Joe Biden,1,a050107,Racism,5
n050108,We should be building rehab centers to have these people housed.,Joe Biden,1,a050108,Racism,5
n050109,"We should decriminalize marijuana, wipe out the record so you can actually say honesty, “You ever been arrested for murder for anything?” You can say no, because we’re going to pass a law saying there is no background that you have to reveal relative to the use of marijuana.",Joe Biden,1,a050109,Racism,5
n050110,And so there’s a lot of things.,Joe Biden,1,a050110,Racism,5
n050111,"But in addition to that, we’ve got to change the system.",Joe Biden,1,a050111,Racism,5
n050112,I joined with a group of people in the House to provide for changing the system from punishment to rehabilitation.,Joe Biden,1,a050112,Racism,5
n050113,"Along with a guy named Marlon Specter, who you may remember, I wrote the Second Chance Act.",Joe Biden,1,a050113,Racism,5
n050114,"In the meantime, an awful lot of people were jailed for minor drug crimes after the Crime Bill.",George Stephanopoulos,4,a050114,Racism,5
n050115,Right.,Joe Biden,1,a050115,Racism,5
n050116,Was it a mistake to support it?,George Stephanopoulos,4,a050116,Racism,5
n050117,"Yes, it was.",Joe Biden,1,a050117,Racism,5
n050118,But here’s where the mistake.,Joe Biden,1,a050118,Racism,5
n050119,The mistake came in terms of what the states did locally.,Joe Biden,1,a050119,Racism,5
n050120,"What we did federally, we said, you remember, George, it was all about the same time for the same crime.",Joe Biden,1,a050120,Racism,5
n050121,"What I had done as the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I took the 10 Circuit Courts of Appeals, took some really brilliant lawyers working for me in Judiciary, we did a study and we determined what happens if, for the first, second, third offense for any crime in the criminal justice system at the federal level, if you’re a Black man and it’s the first time you’ve committed robbery, how long would you go to jail?",Joe Biden,1,a050121,Racism,5
n050122,On average?,Joe Biden,1,a050122,Racism,5
n050123,"If you’re White man, how long?",Joe Biden,1,a050123,Racism,5
n050124,The Black man would go to jail on average 13 years.,Joe Biden,1,a050124,Racism,5
n050125,"White man, two years.",Joe Biden,1,a050125,Racism,5
n050126,I’d go down the list of every single crime.,Joe Biden,1,a050126,Racism,5
n050127,So we set up a sentencing commission.,Joe Biden,1,a050127,Racism,5
n050128,We didn’t set the time.,Joe Biden,1,a050128,Racism,5
n050129,Every single solitary maximum was reduced in there.,Joe Biden,1,a050129,Racism,5
n050130,But what happened was it became the same time for the same crime.,Joe Biden,1,a050130,Racism,5
n050131,"So it said, “You have to serve between one and three years.” And it ended up becoming much lower, Black folks went to jail a lot less than they would have before.",Joe Biden,1,a050131,Racism,5
n050132,But it was a mistake.,Joe Biden,1,a050132,Racism,5
n050133,Let me ask another follow-up on the Crime bill.,George Stephanopoulos,4,a050133,Racism,5
n050134,"It also funded 100,000 police back in 1994.",George Stephanopoulos,4,a050134,Racism,5
n050135,You’ve often said that more cops clearly mean less crime.,George Stephanopoulos,4,a050135,Racism,5
n050136,Do you still believe that?,George Stephanopoulos,4,a050136,Racism,5
n050137,"Yes, if in fact they’re involved in community policing, not jump squads.",Joe Biden,1,a050137,Racism,5
n050138,"For example, when we had community policing, from the mid-’90s on until till Bush got elected, what happened?",Joe Biden,1,a050138,Racism,5
n050139,Violent crime actually went down precipitous.,Joe Biden,1,a050139,Racism,5
n050140,Remember the significant rise in violent crime that was occurring in the late ’80s into the ’90s.,Joe Biden,1,a050140,Racism,5
n050141,It went down and fewer African Americans were arrested because you had the requirement.,Joe Biden,1,a050141,Racism,5
n050142,The cops didn’t like it.,Joe Biden,1,a050142,Racism,5
n050143,"They didn’t like the community policing, because you had to have two people in the vehicle, they had to get out of their cars, they had to introduce themselves to who own the local liquor store, who owned the local grocery store, who was the woman on the corner.",Joe Biden,1,a050143,Racism,5
n050144,"And what they would do, George, they’d actually go and give people their phone numbers.",Joe Biden,1,a050144,Racism,5
n050145,A cop would give the phone number.,Joe Biden,1,a050145,Racism,5
n050146,"So if Nelly Smith was on the second floor where drug deals took place and things happened below her apartment, she could call and say, “It’s Millie, and there’s something going on here.” And they’d never revealed it was her, because they’d know, if she knew that, in fact, they report, they’d never report the crime, she’d never report.",Joe Biden,1,a050146,Racism,5
n050147,So it actually started to come down.,Joe Biden,1,a050147,Racism,5
n050148,And what happened?,Joe Biden,1,a050148,Racism,5
n050149,They eliminated the funding for community policing.,Joe Biden,1,a050149,Racism,5
n050150,"Community policing doesn’t mean more people coming in, in armored Humvees and swarming.",Joe Biden,1,a050150,Racism,5
n050151,"It turned out that by the time we got to the late ’90s and crime had come down so much, the mayors and everybody asked the question, “Where do you want me to spend the money?” They say, “Well, only 1% thought violent crime was a problem.” It was as high as 22%.",Joe Biden,1,a050151,Racism,5
n050152,Right now we have a systemic problem.,George Stephanopoulos,4,a050152,Racism,5
n050153,"How do you get the kind of policing, prevent the kind of policing [crosstalk 00:35:55].",George Stephanopoulos,4,a050153,Racism,5
n050154,You have to change the way in which they [inaudible 00:35:55].,Joe Biden,1,a050154,Racism,5
n050155,"One of the things I’m going to do, George, is what is set up a national study group made up of cops, social workers, as well as made up of the Black community and the Brown community to sit down in the White House and over the next year come up with significant reforms that need to take place within communities.",Joe Biden,1,a050155,Racism,5
n050156,You have to bring them together.,Joe Biden,1,a050156,Racism,5
n050157,"One of the things I’ve observed is, the neighborhood I grew up, I grew up in Claymont, you either became a cop, a firefighter, or a priest.",Joe Biden,1,a050157,Racism,5
n050158,"I wasn’t qualified much to do any one of them, but here’s the deal, all kidding aside.",Joe Biden,1,a050158,Racism,5
n050159,Most cops don’t like bad cops.,Joe Biden,1,a050159,Racism,5
n050160,Correct.,Audience Member 5,10,a050160,Racism,5
n050161,They don’t like it.,Joe Biden,1,a050161,Racism,5
n050162,That’s correct.,Audience Member 5,10,a050162,Racism,5
n050163,And so what happens is they get intimidated into not reporting.,Joe Biden,1,a050163,Racism,5
n050164,So one of the things we do is there has to be transparency available.,Joe Biden,1,a050164,Racism,5
n050165,"We have to be able to go in at the federal level, be able to go in and check out whether or not there’s systematic problems within police departments.",Joe Biden,1,a050165,Racism,5
n050166,"If, in fact, a cop needs to be tried, it’s not the prosecutor in the community, in the district there.",Joe Biden,1,a050166,Racism,5
n050167,You’ve got to go outside the community to get another prosecutor to come in to handle the crime.,Joe Biden,1,a050167,Racism,5
n050168,"There’s a lot of things we’ve learned, and it takes time but we can do this.",Joe Biden,1,a050168,Racism,5
n050169,"You can ban choke holds, but beyond that, you have to teach people how to de-escalate circumstances.",Joe Biden,1,a050169,Racism,5
n050170,De-escalate.,Joe Biden,1,a050170,Racism,5
