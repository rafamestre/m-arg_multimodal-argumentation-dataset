Chris Wallace,Good evening from the Health Education Campus of Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic.,,
Chris Wallace,I’m Chris Wallace of Fox News and I welcome you to the first of the 2020 Presidential Debates between President Donald J. Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden.,,
Chris Wallace,This debate is sponsored by the Commission on Presidential debates.,,
Chris Wallace,"The Commission has designed the format, six roughly 15 minute segments with two minute answers from each candidate to the first question, then open discussion for the rest of each segment.",,
Chris Wallace,Both campaigns have agreed to these rules.,,
Chris Wallace,"For the record, I decided the topics and the questions in each topic.",,
Chris Wallace,I can assure you none of the questions has been shared with the Commission or the two candidates.,,
Chris Wallace,"This debate is being conducted under health and safety protocols designed by the Cleveland Clinic, which is serving as the Health Security advisor to the Commission for all four debates.",,
Chris Wallace,"As a precaution, both campaigns have agreed the candidates will not shake hands at the beginning of tonight’s debate.",,
Chris Wallace,The audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent.,,
Chris Wallace,"No cheers, no boos, or other interruptions so we, and more importantly you, can focus on what the candidates have to say.",,
Chris Wallace,"No noise except right now, as we welcome the Republican nominee, President Trump, and the Democratic nominee Vice President Biden.",,
Joe Biden,"How you doing, man?",,
Donald Trump,How are you doing?,,
Joe Biden,I’m well.,,
Chris Wallace,"Gentlemen, a lot of people been waiting for this night, so let’s get going.",,
Chris Wallace,Our first subject is the Supreme Court.,,
Chris Wallace,"President Trump, you nominated Amy Coney Barrett over the weekend to succeed the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Court.",,
Chris Wallace,You say the Constitution is clear about your obligation and the Senate’s to consider a nominee to the Court.,,
Chris Wallace,"Vice President Biden, you say that this is an effort by the President and Republicans to jam through on an appointment in what you call an abuse of power.",,
Chris Wallace,"My first question to both of you tonight, why are you right in the argument you make and your opponent wrong?",,
Chris Wallace,And where do you think a Justice Barrett would take the court?,,
Chris Wallace,"President Trump, in this first segment, you go first.",,
Chris Wallace,Two minutes.,,
Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, Chris.",,
Donald Trump,I will tell you very simply.,,
Donald Trump,We won the election.,,
Donald Trump,Elections have consequences.,,
Donald Trump,"We have the Senate, we have the White House, and we have a phenomenal nominee respected by all.",,
Donald Trump,"Top, top academic, good in every way.",,
Donald Trump,Good in every way.,,
Donald Trump,"In fact, some of her biggest endorsers are very liberal people from Notre Dame and other places.",,
Donald Trump,So I think she’s going to be fantastic.,,
Donald Trump,We have plenty of time.,,
Donald Trump,Even if we did it after the election itself.,,
Donald Trump,"I have a lot of time after the election, as you know.",,
Donald Trump,So I think that she will be outstanding.,,
Donald Trump,She’s going to be as good as anybody that has served on that court.,,
Donald Trump,We really feel that.,,
Donald Trump,"We have a professor at Notre Dame, highly respected by all, said she’s the single greatest student he’s ever had.",,
Donald Trump,He’s been a professor for a long time at a great school.,,
Donald Trump,"And we won the election and therefore we have the right to choose her, and very few people knowingly would say otherwise.",,
Donald Trump,"And by the way, the Democrats, they wouldn’t even think about not doing it.",,
Donald Trump,The only difference is they’d try and do it faster.,,
Donald Trump,There’s no way they would give it up.,,
Donald Trump,"They had Merrick Garland, but the problem is they didn’t have the election so they were stopped.",,
Donald Trump,"And probably that would happen in reverse, also.",,
Donald Trump,Definitely would happen in reverse.,,
Donald Trump,"So we won the election and we have the right to do it, Chris.",,
Chris Wallace,"President Trump, thank you.",,
Chris Wallace,"Same question to you, Vice President Biden.",,
Chris Wallace,You have two minutes.,,
Joe Biden,"Well, first of all, thank you for doing this and looking forward to this, Mr. President.",,
Donald Trump,"Thank you, Joe.",,
Joe Biden,The American people have a right to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is and that say occurs when they vote for United States Senators and when they vote for the President of United States.,,
Joe Biden,They’re not going to get that chance now because we’re in the middle of an election already.,,
Joe Biden,The election has already started.,,
Joe Biden,Tens of thousands of people already voted and so the thing that should happen is we should wait.,,
Joe Biden,We should wait and see what the outcome of this election is because that’s the only way the American people get to express their view is by who they elect as President and who they elect as Vice President.,,
Joe Biden,"Now, what’s at stake here is the President’s made it clear, he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.",,
Joe Biden,"He’s been running on that, he ran on that and he’s been governing on that.",,
Joe Biden,"He’s in the Supreme Court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which will strip 20 million people from having health insurance now, if it goes into court.",,
Joe Biden,"And the justice, I’m not opposed to the justice, she seems like a very fine person.",,
Joe Biden,"But she’s written, before she went in the bench, which is her right, that she thinks that the Affordable Care Act is not Constitutional.",,
Joe Biden,"The other thing that’s on the court, and if it’s struck down, what happens?",,
Joe Biden,Women’s rights are fundamentally changed.,,
Joe Biden,"Once again, a woman could pay more money because she has a pre-existing condition of pregnancy.",,
Joe Biden,They’re able to charge women more for the same exact procedure a man gets.,,
Joe Biden,"And that ended when we, in fact, passed the Affordable Care Act, and there’s a hundred million people who have pre-existing conditions and they’ll be taken away as well.",,
Joe Biden,"Those pre-existing conditions, insurance companies are going to love this.",,
Joe Biden,And so it’s just not appropriate to do this before this election.,,
Joe Biden,"If he wins the election and the Senate is Republican, then he goes forward.",,
Joe Biden,"If not, we should wait until February.",,
Donald Trump,There aren’t a hundred million people with pre-existing conditions.,,
Donald Trump,"As far as a say is concerned, the people already had their say.",,
Donald Trump,"Okay, Justice Ginsburg said very powerfully, very strongly, at some point 10 years ago or so, she said a President and the Senate is elected for a period of time, but a President is elected for four years.",,
Donald Trump,We’re not elected for three years.,,
Donald Trump,I’m not elected for three years.,,
Donald Trump,"So we have the Senate, we have a President-",,
Joe Biden,He’s elected to the next election.,,
Donald Trump,"During that period of time, during that period of time, we have an opening.",,
Donald Trump,I’m not elected for three years.,,
Donald Trump,I’m elected for four years.,,
Donald Trump,"Joe, the hundred million people is totally wrong.",,
Donald Trump,I don’t know where you got that number.,,
Donald Trump,"The bigger problem that you have is that you’re going to extinguish 180 million people with their private health care, that they’re very happy this.",,
Joe Biden,That’s simply not true.,,
Donald Trump,"Well, you’re certainly going to socialist.",,
Donald Trump,You’re going to socialist-,,
Chris Wallace,"Gentlemen, we’re now into open discussion.",,
Joe Biden,Open discussion.,,
Chris Wallace,"Open discussion, yes, I agree.",,
Chris Wallace,"Go ahead, Vice President.",,
Joe Biden,"Number one, he knows what I proposed.",,
Joe Biden,What I proposed is that we expand Obamacare and we increase it.,,
Joe Biden,We do not wipe any.,,
Joe Biden,"And one of the big debates we had with 23 of my colleagues trying to win the nomination that I won, were saying that Biden wanted to allow people to have private insurance still.",,
Joe Biden,They can.,,
Joe Biden,They do.,,
Joe Biden,They will under my proposal.,,
Donald Trump,That’s not what you’ve said and it’s not what your party is saying.,,
Joe Biden,That is simply a lie.,,
Donald Trump,Your party doesn’t say it.,,
Donald Trump,Your party wants to go socialist medicine and socialist healthcare.,,
Joe Biden,The party is me.,,
Joe Biden,"Right now, I am the Democratic Party.",,
Donald Trump,"And they’re going to dominate you, Joe.",,
Donald Trump,You know that.,,
Joe Biden,I am the Democratic Party right now.,,
Donald Trump,Not according to Harris.,,
Joe Biden,"The platform of the Democratic Party is what I, in fact, approved of, what I approved of.",,
Joe Biden,"Now, here’s the deal.",,
Joe Biden,The deal is that it’s going to wipe out pre-existing conditions.,,
Joe Biden,"And, by the way, the 200,000 people that have died on his watch, how many of those have survived?",,
Joe Biden,"Well, there’s seven million people that contracted COVID.",,
Joe Biden,What does it mean for them going forward if you strike down the Affordable Care Act?,,
Donald Trump,"Joe, you’ve had 308,000 military people dying because you couldn’t provide them proper healthcare in the military.",,
Donald Trump,So don’t tell me about this.,,
Joe Biden,I’m happy to talk about this.,,
Donald Trump,"And if you were here, it wouldn’t be 200, it would be two million people because you were very late on the draw.",,
Donald Trump,"You didn’t want me to ban China, which was heavily infected.",,
Donald Trump,You didn’t want me to ban Europe.,,
Chris Wallace,"All right, gentlemen, Mr. President.",,
Donald Trump,"You would have been much later, Joe, much later.",,
Chris Wallace,Mr. President.,,
Donald Trump,We’re talking about two million people.,,
Joe Biden,You’re not going to be able to shut him up.,,
Chris Wallace,"Mr. President, as the moderator, we are going to talk about COVID in the next segment.",,
Chris Wallace,But go ahead.,,
Joe Biden,Let me finish.,,
Joe Biden,The point is that the President also is opposed to Roe V. Wade.,,
Joe Biden,"That’s on the ballot as well and the court, in the court, and so that’s also at stake right now.",,
Joe Biden,And so the election is all-,,
Donald Trump,You don’t know what’s on the ballot.,,
Donald Trump,Why is it on the ballot?,,
Donald Trump,Why is it on the ballot?,,
Donald Trump,It’s not on the ballot.,,
Joe Biden,It’s on the ballot in the court.,,
Donald Trump,I don’t think so.,,
Joe Biden,In the court.,,
Donald Trump,There’s nothing happening there.,,
Joe Biden,Donald would you just be quiet for a minute.,,
Donald Trump,You don’t know her view on Roe V. Wade?,,
Donald Trump,You don’t know here view.,,
Chris Wallace,"Well, all right.",,
Chris Wallace,All right.,,
Chris Wallace,Let’s talk.,,
Chris Wallace,"We’ve got a lot to unpack here, gentlemen.",,
Chris Wallace,We’ve got a lot of time.,,
Chris Wallace,"On healthcare, and then we’ll come back to Roe V. Wade.",,
Joe Biden,All right.,,
Chris Wallace,"Mr. President, the Supreme Court will hear a case a week after the election in which the Trump Administration, along with 18 state Attorney Generals are seeking to overturn Obamacare, to end Obamacare.",,
Donald Trump,That’s right.,,
Chris Wallace,You have spent the last week-,,
Donald Trump,Because they want to give good healthcare.,,
Chris Wallace,"If I may ask my question, sir.",,
Joe Biden,Good healthcare.,,
Chris Wallace,"Over the last four years, you have promised to repeal and replace Obamacare, but you have never in these four years come up with a plan, a comprehensive plan, to replace Obamacare.",,
Donald Trump,"Yes, I have.",,
Donald Trump,"Of course, I have.",,
Donald Trump,The individual mandate.,,
Chris Wallace,[crosstalk 00:11:26] when I finish I’m going to give an opportunity-,,
Donald Trump,Excuse me.,,
Donald Trump,"I got rid of the individual mandate, which was a big chunk of Obamacare.",,
Chris Wallace,That’s not a comprehensive place.,,
Donald Trump,That is absolutely a big thing.,,
Donald Trump,That was the worst part of Obamacare.,,
Chris Wallace,"I didn’t ask, sir.",,
Donald Trump,"Chris, that was the worst part of Obamacare.",,
Chris Wallace,You’re debating him not me.,,
Chris Wallace,Let me ask my question.,,
Donald Trump,"Well, I’ll ask Joe.",,
Donald Trump,The individual mandate was the most unpopular aspect of Obamacare.,,
Chris Wallace,Mr. President.,,
Donald Trump,I got rid of it.,,
Donald Trump,And we will protect people.,,
Chris Wallace,"Mr. President, I’m the moderator of this debate and I would like you to let me ask my question and then you can answer.",,
Donald Trump,Go ahead.,,
Chris Wallace,"You, in the course of these four years, have never come up with a comprehensive plan to replace Obamacare, and just this last Thursday you signed a largely symbolic Executive Order to protect people with pre-existing conditions five days before this debate.",,
Chris Wallace,"So my question, sir, is what is the Trump healthcare plan?",,
Donald Trump,"Well, first of all, I guess I’m debating you, not him, but that’s okay.",,
Donald Trump,I’m not surprised.,,
Donald Trump,Let me just tell you something.,,
Donald Trump,There’s nothing symbolic.,,
Donald Trump,I’m cutting drug prices.,,
Donald Trump,"I’m going with Favored Nations, which no President has the courage to do because you’re going against big pharma.",,
Donald Trump,Drug prices will be coming down 80 or 90%.,,
Donald Trump,"You could have done it during your 47 year period in government, but you didn’t do it.",,
Donald Trump,Nobody’s done it.,,
Donald Trump,So we’re cutting healthcare.,,
Chris Wallace,What about pre-existing conditions?,,
Donald Trump,All of the things that we’ve done.,,
Joe Biden,He has not done healthcare.,,
Donald Trump,I’ll give you an example.,,
Donald Trump,"Insulin, it was destroying families, destroying people, the cost.",,
Donald Trump,"I’m getting it for so cheap it’s like water, you want to know the truth.",,
Donald Trump,So cheap.,,
Donald Trump,Take a look at all of the drugs that what we’re doing.,,
Donald Trump,"Prescription drug prices, we’re going to allow our Governors now to go to other countries to buy drugs because when they paid just a tiny fraction of what we do.",,
Chris Wallace,"Okay, like I say, this is open discussion.",,
Donald Trump,This is big stuff.,,
Chris Wallace,"Sir, you’ll be happy.",,
Chris Wallace,"I’m about to pick up on one of your points to ask the Vice President, which is, he points out that you would like to add a public option to Obamacare.",,
Joe Biden,Yes.,,
Chris Wallace,And the argument that he makes and other Republicans make is that that is going to end private insurance.,,
Joe Biden,It is not.,,
Chris Wallace,If I start asking the question.,,
Donald Trump,"That’s not what your party says, by the way.",,
Chris Wallace,And it will end private insurance and create a government takeover of health.,,
Joe Biden,It does not.,,
Joe Biden,"It’s only for those people who are so poor they qualify for Medicaid they can get that free in most States, except Governors who want to deny people who are poor Medicaid.",,
Joe Biden,Anyone who qualifies for Medicaid would automatically be enrolled in the public option.,,
Joe Biden,The vast majority of the American people would still not be in that option.,,
Joe Biden,Number one.,,
Joe Biden,Number two.,,
Donald Trump,"Joe, you agreed with Bernie Sanders, who’s far left, on the manifesto, we call it.",,
Donald Trump,And that gives you socialized medicine.,,
Joe Biden,"Look, hey.",,
Donald Trump,Are you saying you didn’t agree?,,
Joe Biden,I’m not going to listen to him.,,
Joe Biden,The fact of the matter is I beat Bernie Sanders.,,
Donald Trump,Not by much.,,
Joe Biden,I beat him by a whole hell of a lot.,,
Donald Trump,Not by much.,,
Joe Biden,"I’m here standing facing you, old buddy.",,
Donald Trump,If Pocahontas would have left two days early you would have lost every primary.,,
Joe Biden,All he knows how to do-,,
Donald Trump,"On Super Tuesday, you got very lucky.",,
Joe Biden,Look he’s the deal.,,
Joe Biden,I got very lucky.,,
Joe Biden,I’m going to get very lucky tonight as well.,,
Donald Trump,With what?,,
Joe Biden,And tonight I’m going to make sure.,,
Donald Trump,With what?,,
Joe Biden,"Because here’s the deal, here’s the deal.",,
Joe Biden,The fact is that everything he’s saying so far is simply a lie.,,
Joe Biden,I’m not here to call out his lies.,,
Joe Biden,Everybody knows he’s a liar.,,
Donald Trump,But you agree.,,
Donald Trump,"Joe, you’re the liar.",,
Donald Trump,You graduated last in your class not first in your class.,,
Joe Biden,"God, I want to make sure-",,
Chris Wallace,"Mr. President, can you let him finish, sir?",,
Joe Biden,"No, he doesn’t know how to do that.",,
Donald Trump,You’d be surprised.,,
Donald Trump,You’d be surprised.,,
Donald Trump,"Go ahead, Joe.",,
Joe Biden,"The wrong guy, the wrong night, at the wrong time.",,
Donald Trump,"Listen, you agreed with Bernie Sanders and the manifesto.",,
Joe Biden,"There is no manifesto, number one.",,
Chris Wallace,"Please let him speak, Mr. President.",,
Joe Biden,Number two.,,
Donald Trump,He just lost the left.,,
Joe Biden,Number two.,,
Donald Trump,You just lost the left.,,
Donald Trump,"You agreed with Bernie Sanders on a plan that you absolutely agreed to and under that plan [crosstalk 00:15:10], they call it socialized medicine.",,
Chris Wallace,Mr. President.,,
Joe Biden,"I’ll tell you what, he is not for any help for people needing healthcare.",,
Donald Trump,"Who is, Bernie?",,
Joe Biden,"Because he, in fact, already has costs 10 million people their healthcare that they had from their employers because of his recession.",,
Joe Biden,Number one.,,
Joe Biden,"Number two, there are 20 million people getting healthcare through Obamacare now that he wants to take it away.",,
Joe Biden,He won’t ever look you in the eye and say that’s what he wants to do.,,
Joe Biden,Take it away.,,
Donald Trump,"No, I want to give them better healthcare at a much lower price, because Obamacare is no good.",,
Joe Biden,He doesn’t know how.,,
Joe Biden,He doesn’t know how to do that.,,
Donald Trump,I’ve already fixed it.,,
Joe Biden,He has never offered a plan.,,
Donald Trump,We’ve already fixed it to an extent.,,
Donald Trump,"Obamacare, as you might know but probably don’t, Obamacare is no good.",,
Chris Wallace,"Gentlemen, you realize if you’re both speaking at the same time.",,
Chris Wallace,Let the President.,,
Chris Wallace,"Go ahead, sir.",,
Donald Trump,Obamacare is no good.,,
Donald Trump,We made it better and I had a choice to make very early on.,,
Donald Trump,We took away the individual mandate.,,
Donald Trump,"We guaranteed pre-existing conditions, but took away the individual mandate.",,
Donald Trump,"Listen, this is the way it is.",,
Donald Trump,"And that destroyed … They shouldn’t even call it Obamacare, then I had a choice to make, do I let my people run it really well or badly?",,
Donald Trump,"If I run it badly, they’ll probably blame him, but they’ll blame me.",,
Donald Trump,"But more importantly, I want to help people.",,
Donald Trump,Okay.,,
Donald Trump,"I said, “You’ve got to run it so well.” And I just had a meeting with them.",,
Donald Trump,"They said the problem is, no matter how well you run Obamacare, it’s a disaster.",,
Donald Trump,It’s too expensive.,,
Donald Trump,"Premiums are too high, that it doesn’t work.",,
Donald Trump,So we do want to get rid of it.,,
Donald Trump,"Chris, we want to get rid of that and give something that’s cheaper and better.",,
Chris Wallace,"I understand that, sir.",,
Chris Wallace,But I have to give you roughly equal time.,,
Donald Trump,Go ahead.,,
Chris Wallace,"Please let the Vice President talk, sir.",,
Donald Trump,Good.,,
Joe Biden,He has no plan for healthcare.,,
Donald Trump,"Of course, we do.",,
Chris Wallace,Please.,,
Joe Biden,He sends out wishful thinking.,,
Joe Biden,He has Executive Orders that have no power.,,
Joe Biden,He hasn’t lowered drug costs for anybody.,,
Joe Biden,He’s been promising a healthcare plan since he got elected.,,
Joe Biden,"He has none, like almost everything else he talks about.",,
Joe Biden,He does not have a plan.,,
Joe Biden,He doesn’t have a plan.,,
Joe Biden,And the fact is this man doesn’t know what he’s talking about.,,
Joe Biden,[crosstalk 00:17:14].,,
Chris Wallace,"All right, I have one final question for you.",,
Joe Biden,Sure.,,
Chris Wallace,"Mr. Vice President, if Senate Republicans, we were talking originally about the Supreme Court here, if Senate Republicans go ahead and confirm Justice Barrett there has been talk about ending the filibuster or even packing the court, adding to the nine justices there.",,
Chris Wallace,You call this a distraction by the President.,,
Chris Wallace,"But, in fact, it wasn’t brought up by the President.",,
Chris Wallace,It was brought up by some of your Democratic colleagues in the Congress.,,
Chris Wallace,"So my question to you is, you have refused in the past to talk about it, are you willing to tell the American tonight whether or not you will support either ending the filibuster or packing the court?",,
Joe Biden,"Whatever position I take on that, that’ll become the issue.",,
Joe Biden,The issue is the American people should speak.,,
Joe Biden,You should go out and vote.,,
Joe Biden,You’re voting now.,,
Joe Biden,Vote and let your Senators know strongly how you feel.,,
Donald Trump,Are you going to pack the court?,,
Joe Biden,Vote now.,,
Donald Trump,Are you going to pack the court?,,
Joe Biden,"Make sure you, in fact, let people know, your Senators.",,
Donald Trump,He doesn’t want to answer the question.,,
Joe Biden,I’m not going to answer the question.,,
Donald Trump,Why wouldn’t you answer that question?,,
Donald Trump,You want to put a lot of new Supreme Court Justices.,,
Donald Trump,Radical left.,,
Joe Biden,"Will you shut up, man?",,
Donald Trump,"Listen, who is on your list, Joe?",,
Donald Trump,Who’s on your list?,,
Chris Wallace,"Gentlemen, I think we’ve ended this-",,
Joe Biden,This is so un-Presidential.,,
Donald Trump,He’s going to pack the court.,,
Donald Trump,He is not going to give a list.,,
Chris Wallace,We have ended the segment.,,
Chris Wallace,We’re going to move on to the second segment.,,
Joe Biden,"That was really a productive segment, wasn’t it?",,
Joe Biden,"Keep yapping, man.",,
Donald Trump,"The people understand, Joe.",,
Joe Biden,They sure do.,,
Donald Trump,"47 years, you’ve done nothing.",,
Donald Trump,They’re understand.,,
Chris Wallace,"All right, the second subject is COVID-19, which is an awfully serious subject.",,
Chris Wallace,So let’s try to be serious about it.,,
Chris Wallace,"We have had more than seven million cases of coronavirus in the United States and more than 200,000 people have died.",,
Chris Wallace,"Even after we produce a vaccine, experts say that it could be months or even years before we come back to anything approaching normal.",,
Chris Wallace,"My question for both of you is, based on what you have said and done so far, and what you have said you would do starting in 2021, why should the American people trust you more than your opponent to deal with this public health crisis going forward?",,
Chris Wallace,"In this case, the question goes to you first, sir.",,
Chris Wallace,"Two minutes, uninterrupted.",,
Joe Biden,Good luck.,,
Joe Biden,"200,000 dead.",,
Joe Biden,"As you said, over seven million infected in the United States.",,
Joe Biden,"We, in fact, have 4% of the world’s population, 20% of the deaths.",,
Joe Biden,"40,000 people a day are contracting COVID.",,
Joe Biden,"In addition to that, about between 750 and 1000 people a day are dying.",,
Joe Biden,"When he was presented with that number, he said, “It is what it is.” Well, it is what it is because you are who you are.",,
Joe Biden,That’s why it is.,,
Joe Biden,The President has no plan.,,
Joe Biden,He hasn’t laid out anything.,,
Joe Biden,He knew all the way back in February how serious this crisis was.,,
Joe Biden,He knew it was a deadly disease.,,
Joe Biden,What did he do?,,
Joe Biden,He’s on tape as acknowledging he knew it.,,
Joe Biden,He said he didn’t tell us or give people a warning of it because he didn’t want to panic the American people.,,
Joe Biden,You don’t panic.,,
Joe Biden,He panicked.,,
Joe Biden,"In addition to that, what did he do?",,
Joe Biden,He went in and we were insisting that the people we had in the ground in China should be able to go to Wuhan and determine for themselves how dangerous this was.,,
Joe Biden,He did not even ask Xi to do that.,,
Donald Trump,Wrong.,,
Joe Biden,He told us what a great job Xi was doing.,,
Joe Biden,He said we owe him debt of gratitude for being so transparent with us.,,
Joe Biden,And what did he do then?,,
Joe Biden,He then did nothing.,,
Joe Biden,He waited and waited and waited.,,
Joe Biden,He still doesn’t have a plan.,,
Donald Trump,Wrong.,,
Chris Wallace,"Sir, it’s his two minutes.",,
Donald Trump,It’s so wrong.,,
Joe Biden,"I laid out back in March, exactly what we should be doing.",,
Joe Biden,"And I laid out again in July, what we should be doing.",,
Joe Biden,We should be providing all the protective gear possible.,,
Joe Biden,We should be providing the money the House has passed in order to be able to go out and get people the help they need to keep their businesses open.,,
Joe Biden,Open schools cost a lot of money.,,
Joe Biden,You should get out of your bunker and get out of the sand trap in your golf course and go in the Oval Office and bring together the Democrats and Republicans and fund what needs to be done now to save lives.,,
Donald Trump,"So, if we would have listened to you.",,
Chris Wallace,"Wait, wait.",,
Chris Wallace,"You have two minutes, sir.",,
Donald Trump,"If we would’ve listened to you, the country would have been left wide open, millions of people would have died, not 200,000.",,
Donald Trump,And one person is too much.,,
Donald Trump,It’s China’s fault.,,
Donald Trump,It should have never happened.,,
Donald Trump,"They stopped it from going in, but it was China’s fault.",,
Donald Trump,"And, by the way, when you talk about numbers, you don’t know how many people died in China.",,
Donald Trump,You don’t know how many people died in Russia.,,
Donald Trump,You don’t know how many people died in India.,,
Donald Trump,"They don’t exactly give you a straight count, just so you understand.",,
Donald Trump,"But if you look at what we’ve done, I closed it and you said, “He’s xenophobic.",,
Donald Trump,"He’s a racist and he’s xenophobic,” because you didn’t think I should have closed our country.",,
Donald Trump,Wait a minute.,,
Chris Wallace,"Sir, it’s his two minutes.",,
Donald Trump,You didn’t think we should have closed our country because you thought it was terrible.,,
Donald Trump,You wouldn’t have closed it for another two months.,,
Donald Trump,"By my doing it early, in fact, Dr. Fauci said, “President Trump saved thousands of lives.” Many of your Democrat Governors said, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We worked with the Governor.",,
Donald Trump,"Oh really, go take a look.",,
Donald Trump,The Governors said I did a phenomenal job.,,
Donald Trump,Most of them said that.,,
Donald Trump,"In fact, people that would not be necessarily on my side said that, “President Trump did a phenomenal job.” We did.",,
Donald Trump,We got the gowns.,,
Donald Trump,We got the masks.,,
Donald Trump,We made the ventilators.,,
Donald Trump,You wouldn’t have made ventilators.,,
Donald Trump,And now we’re weeks away from a vaccine.,,
Donald Trump,We’re doing therapeutics already.,,
Donald Trump,Fewer people are dying when they get sick.,,
Donald Trump,Far fewer people are dying.,,
Donald Trump,We’ve done a great job.,,
Donald Trump,"The only thing I haven’t done a good job, and that’s because of the fake news, no matter what you say to them, they give you a bad press on it.",,
Donald Trump,It’s just fake news.,,
Donald Trump,"They give you good press, they give me bad press because that’s the way it is, unfortunately.",,
Donald Trump,But let me just say something.,,
Donald Trump,I don’t care.,,
Donald Trump,I’ve gotten used to it.,,
Donald Trump,"But I’ll tell you, Joe, you could never have done the job that we did.",,
Donald Trump,You don’t have it in your blood.,,
Donald Trump,"You could’ve never done that, Joe.",,
Joe Biden,I know how to do the job.,,
Joe Biden,I know how to get the job done.,,
Donald Trump,"Well, you didn’t do very well in Swine Flu.",,
Donald Trump,"H1-N1, you were a disaster.",,
Donald Trump,Your own Chief of Staff said you were a disaster.,,
Joe Biden,"14,000 people died, not 200,000.",,
Donald Trump,"A far less lethal disease, by the way.",,
Chris Wallace,"Sir, you made a point.",,
Chris Wallace,Let him answer it.,,
Joe Biden,And there was no one … We didn’t shut down the economy.,,
Joe Biden,This is his economy he shut down.,,
Joe Biden,"The reason it’s shut down is because, look, you folks at home.",,
Joe Biden,How many of you got up this morning and had an empty chair at the kitchen table because someone died of COVID?,,
Joe Biden,"How many of you are in a situation where you lost your mom or dad and you couldn’t even speak to them, you had a nurse holding a phone up so you could in fact say goodbye?",,
Donald Trump,"We would have lost far more people, far more people.",,
Donald Trump,You would have been months late.,,
Donald Trump,"You’re months behind me, Joe.",,
Joe Biden,"His own CDC Director says we could lose as many as another 200,000 people between now and the end of the year.",,
Joe Biden,"And he said, if we just wear a mask, we can save half those numbers.",,
Joe Biden,Just a mask.,,
Joe Biden,"And by the way, in terms of the whole notion of a vaccine, we’re for a vaccine, but I don’t trust him at all.",,
Joe Biden,Nor do you.,,
Joe Biden,I know you don’t.,,
Joe Biden,What we trust is a scientist.,,
Donald Trump,"You don’t trust Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer?",,
Chris Wallace,"Okay, gentlemen, gentlemen.",,
Chris Wallace,Let me move on to questions about the future because you both have touched on two of the questions I’m going to ask.,,
Chris Wallace,"Focusing on the future first, President Trump, you have repeatedly either contradicted or been at odds with some of your governments own top scientists.",,
Chris Wallace,"The week before last, the Head of the Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Redfield said it would be summer before the vaccine would become generally available to the public.",,
Chris Wallace,You said that he was confused and mistaken.,,
Chris Wallace,Those were your two words.,,
Chris Wallace,"But Dr. Slaoui, the head of your Operation Warp Speed, has said exactly the same thing.",,
Chris Wallace,Are they both wrong?,,
Donald Trump,"Well, I’ve spoken to the companies and we can have it a lot sooner.",,
Donald Trump,It’s a very political thing because people like this would rather make it political than save lives.,,
Joe Biden,God.,,
Donald Trump,It is a very political thing.,,
Donald Trump,"I’ve spoken to Pfizer, I’ve spoken to all of the people that you have to speak to, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and others.",,
Donald Trump,They can go faster than that by a lot.,,
Donald Trump,"It’s become very political because the left… Or I don’t know if I call them left, I don’t know what I call them.",,
Chris Wallace,"So you’re suggesting that the head of your Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Slaoui-",,
Donald Trump,I disagree with him.,,
Donald Trump,"No, I disagree with both of them.",,
Donald Trump,And he didn’t say that.,,
Donald Trump,"He said it could be there, but it could also be much sooner.",,
Donald Trump,I had him in my office two days ago.,,
Chris Wallace,"He talked about the summer, sir, before it’s generally available, just like Dr. Redfield.",,
Donald Trump,Because he said it’s a possibility that we’ll have the answer before November 1st.,,
Donald Trump,It could also be after that.,,
Chris Wallace,"I’m talking about when it’s generally available, not-",,
Donald Trump,"Well, we’re going to deliver it right away.",,
Donald Trump,We have the military all set up.,,
Donald Trump,"Logistically, they’re all set up.",,
Donald Trump,"We have our military that delivers soldiers and they can do 200,000 a day.",,
Donald Trump,They’re going to be delivering-,,
Joe Biden,This is the same man who told you-,,
Donald Trump,It’s all set up.,,
Joe Biden,"… by Easter, this would be gone away.",,
Joe Biden,"By the warm weather, it’d be gone.",,
Joe Biden,"Miraculous, like a miracle.",,
Joe Biden,"And by the way, maybe you could inject some bleach in your arm, and that would take care of it.",,
Joe Biden,This is the same man.,,
Donald Trump,"That was said sarcastically, and you know that.",,
Donald Trump,That was said sarcastically.,,
Joe Biden,So here’s the deal.,,
Joe Biden,This man is talking about a vaccine.,,
Joe Biden,"Every serious company is talking about maybe having a vaccine done by the end of the year, but the distribution of that vaccine will not occur until sometime beginning of the middle of next year to get it out, if we get the vaccine.",,
Joe Biden,And pray God we will.,,
Joe Biden,Pray God we will.,,
Chris Wallace,"Mr. Vice President, I want to pick up-",,
Donald Trump,You’ll have the vaccine sooner than that.,,
Chris Wallace,I want to pick up on this question though.,,
Chris Wallace,"You say the public can trust the scientists, but they can’t trust President Trump.",,
Chris Wallace,"In fact, you said that again tonight.",,
Chris Wallace,"Your running mate, Senator Harris, goes further, saying that public health experts quote, “Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.” Given the fact that polls already show that people are concerned about the vaccine and are reluctant to take it, are you and your running mate, Senator Harris, contributing to that fear?",,
Joe Biden,No more than the question you just asked him.,,
Joe Biden,You pointed out he puts pressure and disagrees with his own scientists.,,
Chris Wallace,But you’re saying you can’t-,,
Joe Biden,Everybody knows-,,
Chris Wallace,Or Senator Harris is saying you can’t trust the scientist.,,
Joe Biden,"Well, no, no.",,
Joe Biden,You can trust the scientist.,,
Joe Biden,She didn’t say that.,,
Joe Biden,You can trust the-,,
Chris Wallace,"She said that public health experts quote, “Will be muzzled, will be suppressed.”",,
Joe Biden,Yes.,,
Joe Biden,"Well, that’s what he’s going to try to do, but there’s thousands of scientists out there, like here at this great hospital that don’t work for him.",,
Joe Biden,Their job doesn’t depend on him.,,
Joe Biden,They’re the people… And by the way-,,
Donald Trump,We spoke to the scientists that are in charge-,,
Joe Biden,By the way-,,
Donald Trump,… they will have the vaccine very soon.,,
Chris Wallace,Let him finish.,,
Joe Biden,Do you believe for a moment what he’s telling you in light of all the lies he’s told you about the whole issue relating to COVID?,,
Joe Biden,"He still hasn’t even acknowledged that he knew this was happening, knew how dangerous it was going to be back in February, and he didn’t even tell you.",,
Joe Biden,He’s on record as saying it.,,
Joe Biden,He panicked or he just looked at the stock market.,,
Joe Biden,One of the two.,,
Joe Biden,Because guess what?,,
Joe Biden,"A lot of people died and a lot more are going to die unless he gets a lot smarter, a lot quicker-",,
Chris Wallace,Mr. President?,,
Donald Trump,Did you use the word smart?,,
Donald Trump,"So you said you went to Delaware State, but you forgot the name of your college.",,
Donald Trump,You didn’t go to Delaware State.,,
Donald Trump,You graduated either the lowest or almost the lowest in your class.,,
Donald Trump,Don’t ever use the word smart with me.,,
Donald Trump,Don’t ever use that word.,,
Joe Biden,"Oh, give me a break.",,
Donald Trump,Because you know what?,,
Donald Trump,"There’s nothing smart about you, Joe.",,
Donald Trump,47 years you’ve done nothing.,,
Joe Biden,"Well, let’s have this debate-",,
Donald Trump,"Let me just tell you something, Joe.",,
Donald Trump,"If you would have had the charge of what I was put through, I had to close the greatest economy of the history of our country.",,
Donald Trump,"And by the way, now it’s being built again and it’s going up fast.",,
Chris Wallace,"We’ll get to the economy in the next segment, sir.",,
Donald Trump,Okay.,,
Donald Trump,It’s going up fast.,,
Donald Trump,I look forward to talking about it.,,
Chris Wallace,Okay.,,
Chris Wallace,"When it comes to how the virus has been handled so far, the two of you have taken very different approaches, and this is going to affect how the virus is handled going forward by whichever of you ends up becoming the next president.",,
Chris Wallace,I want to quickly go through several of those.,,
Chris Wallace,Reopenings.,,
Chris Wallace,"Vice President Biden, you have been much more reluctant than President Trump about reopening the economy and schools.",,
Chris Wallace,"Why, sir?",,
Joe Biden,Because he doesn’t have a plan.,,
Joe Biden,"If I were running it, I’d know what the plan is.",,
Joe Biden,"You’ve got to provide these businesses the ability to have the money to be able to reopen with the PPE, as well as with the sanitation they need.",,
Joe Biden,You have to provide them classic-,,
Donald Trump,Tell that to Nancy Pelosi.,,
Joe Biden,Will he just shush for a minute?,,
Donald Trump,"Tell that to Nancy Pelosi, and Schumer [crosstalk 00:04:52] Chuck.",,
Joe Biden,"Nancy Pelosi and Schumer, they have a plan.",,
Joe Biden,He won’t even meet with them.,,
Joe Biden,The Republicans won’t meet in the Senate.,,
Joe Biden,He sits in his golf course.,,
Joe Biden,"Well, I mean, literally, think about it.",,
Joe Biden,Think about it.,,
Donald Trump,"You probably play more than I do, Joe.",,
Chris Wallace,What about this question of reopenings and the fact-,,
Donald Trump,"Well, he wants to shut down this country and I want to keep it open, and we did a great thing by shutting it down-",,
Joe Biden,You just admitted you’d shut it down.,,
Donald Trump,"Wait a minute, Joe.",,
Donald Trump,"Let me shut you down for a second, Joe, just for one second.",,
Donald Trump,He wants to shut down the country.,,
Donald Trump,We just went through it.,,
Donald Trump,"We had to, because we didn’t know anything about the disease.",,
Donald Trump,"Now we’ve found that elderly people with heart problems and diabetes and different problems are very, very vulnerable.",,
Donald Trump,We learned a lot.,,
Donald Trump,"Young children aren’t, even younger people aren’t.",,
Donald Trump,"We’ve learned a lot, but he wants to shut it down.",,
Donald Trump,More people will be hurt by continuing.,,
Donald Trump,"If you look at Pennsylvania, if you look at certain states that have been shut down, they have Democrat governors, all, one of the reasons they shut down is because they want to keep it shut down until after the election on November 3rd.",,
Chris Wallace,All right.,,
Chris Wallace,I want to move onto another-,,
Donald Trump,Because it’s a political thing.,,
Chris Wallace,I want to move onto another subject.,,
Joe Biden,I got to respond to that.,,
Chris Wallace,I want to move-,,
Donald Trump,But those states-,,
Chris Wallace,"Gentlemen, I want to move onto another subject.",,
Donald Trump,Those states are not doing well that are shut down right now.,,
Joe Biden,I got to respond to that.,,
Donald Trump,He wants to shut down the whole country.,,
Chris Wallace,"President Trump, you have begun to increasingly question the effectiveness of masks as a disease preventer.",,
Chris Wallace,"And in fact, recently you have cited the issue of waiters touching their masks and touching plates.",,
Chris Wallace,Are you questioning the efficacy of masks?,,
Donald Trump,"No, I think masks are okay.",,
Donald Trump,"You have to understand, if you look… I mean, I have a mask right here.",,
Donald Trump,I put a mask on when I think I need it.,,
Donald Trump,"Tonight, as an example, everybody’s had a test and you’ve had social distancing and all of the things that you have to, but I wear masks-",,
Joe Biden,Just like your rally.,,
Donald Trump,… when needed.,,
Donald Trump,"When needed, I wear masks.",,
Chris Wallace,Okay.,,
Chris Wallace,Let me ask-,,
Donald Trump,I don’t wear a mask like him.,,
Donald Trump,"Every time you see him, he’s got a mask.",,
Donald Trump,He could be speaking 200 feet away from him and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen.,,
Donald Trump,I will say this-,,
Chris Wallace,"Vice President Biden, go ahead, sir.",,
Joe Biden,"Look, the way to open businesses is give them the wherewithal to be able open.",,
Joe Biden,"We provided money, the-",,
Chris Wallace,"But I was asking you, sir, about masks.",,
Joe Biden,"Well, masks make a big difference.",,
Joe Biden,"His own head of the CDC said if we just wore masks between now, if everybody wore a mask and social distanced between now and January, we’d probably save up to 100,000 lives.",,
Joe Biden,It matters.,,
Joe Biden,It matters.,,
Donald Trump,And they’ve also said the opposite.,,
Donald Trump,They’ve also said-,,
Joe Biden,No serious person has said the opposite.,,
Joe Biden,No serious person.,,
Chris Wallace,Okay.,,
Chris Wallace,I want to ask you-,,
Donald Trump,Dr. Fauci.,,
Donald Trump,Dr. Fauci said the opposite.,,
Joe Biden,He did not say the opposite.,,
Chris Wallace,"I want to ask you, we’ve got a little than a minute left in this segment.",,
Donald Trump,"He said very strongly, “Masks are not good.” Then he changed his mind.",,
Donald Trump,"He said, “Masks are good.”",,
Chris Wallace,I want to ask-,,
Donald Trump,I’m okay with masks.,,
Donald Trump,I’m not fighting masks.,,
Chris Wallace,I want to ask you both about one last subject because your different approaches has even affected the way that you have campaigned.,,
Chris Wallace,"President Trump, you’re holding large rallies with crowds packed together, thousands of people.",,
Donald Trump,Outside.,,
Chris Wallace,Outside.,,
Chris Wallace,"Yes, sir.",,
Chris Wallace,Agreed.,,
Chris Wallace,"Vice President Biden, you are holding much smaller events with-",,
Donald Trump,Because nobody will show up.,,
Chris Wallace,… people with masks.,,
Donald Trump,"Well, it’s true.",,
Donald Trump,Nobody shows up to his rallies.,,
Chris Wallace,All right.,,
Chris Wallace,"In any case, why you holding the big rallies?",,
Chris Wallace,Why you not?,,
Chris Wallace,"You go first, sir.",,
Donald Trump,Because people want to hear what I have to say.,,
Donald Trump,I mean-,,
Chris Wallace,But are not worried about us spreading disease?,,
Donald Trump,"… I’m doing my job as a president, and I’ll have 25, 35,000 people show up at airports.",,
Donald Trump,We use airports and hangers and we have a lot of people-,,
Chris Wallace,"Are you not worried about the disease issues, sir?",,
Donald Trump,"Well, so far we have had no problem whatsoever.",,
Donald Trump,It’s outside.,,
Donald Trump,That’s a big difference according to the experts.,,
Donald Trump,"We do them outside, we have tremendous crowds, as you see, and literally on 24 hours notice.",,
Donald Trump,And Joe does the circles and has three people someplace.,,
Joe Biden,"By the way, did you see one of the last big rallies he had?",,
Joe Biden,"A reporter came up to him to ask him a question, he said, “No, no, no.",,
Joe Biden,"Stand back, put on your mask, put on a mask.",,
Joe Biden,Have you been tested?,,
Joe Biden,"I’m way far away from those other people.” That’s what he said, “I’m going to be okay.” He’s not worried about you.",,
Joe Biden,He’s not worried about the people out there [crosstalk 00:08:48].,,
Donald Trump,We’ve had no negative effect.,,
Joe Biden,No negative effect.,,
Joe Biden,Come on.,,
Donald Trump,"We’ve had no negative effect, and we’ve had 35, 40,000 people at these rallies.",,
Chris Wallace,All right.,,
Chris Wallace,Do you want to just quickly finish up?,,
Chris Wallace,Because I want to move on to our next-,,
Joe Biden,"Yes, I would.",,
Joe Biden,"He’s been totally irresponsible the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to.",,
Joe Biden,He’s a fool on this.,,
Donald Trump,"If you could get the crowds, you would have done the same thing.",,
Donald Trump,But you can’t.,,
Donald Trump,Nobody cares.,,
Chris Wallace,"Gentlemen, can we move on to the-",,
Donald Trump,No cares.,,
Chris Wallace,"Gentlemen, can we move on to the economy?",,
Donald Trump,Yes.,,
Chris Wallace,"The economy is, I think it’s fair to say, recovering faster than expected from the shutdown-",,
Donald Trump,Much faster.,,
Chris Wallace,… in the second quarter.,,
Chris Wallace,The unemployment rate fell to 8.4% last month.,,
Chris Wallace,"The Federal Reserve says the hit to growth, which is going to be there, is not going to be nearly as big as they had expected.",,
Chris Wallace,"President Trump, you say we are in a V-shaped recovery.",,
Chris Wallace,"Vice President Biden, you say it’s more of a K-shape.",,
Chris Wallace,What difference does that mean to the American people in terms of the economy?,,
Chris Wallace,"President Trump, in this segment you go first.",,
Donald Trump,So we built the greatest economy in history.,,
Donald Trump,We closed it down because of the China plague.,,
Donald Trump,"When the plague came in, we closed it down, which was very hard psychologically to do.",,
Donald Trump,He didn’t think we should close it down and he was wrong.,,
Donald Trump,"Again, two million people would be dead now instead of… Still, 204,000 people is too much.",,
Donald Trump,One person is too much.,,
Donald Trump,Should have never happened from China.,,
Donald Trump,But what happened is we closed it down and now we’re reopening and we’re doing record business.,,
Donald Trump,We had 10.4 million people in a four month period that we’ve put back into the workforce.,,
Donald Trump,That’s a record the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before.,,
Donald Trump,And he wants to close down the… He will shut it down again.,,
Donald Trump,He will destroy this country.,,
Donald Trump,"A lot of people, between drugs and alcohol and depression, when you start shutting it down, you take a look at what’s happening at some of your Democrat-run states where they have these tough shutdowns.",,
Donald Trump,And I’m telling you it’s because they don’t want to open it.,,
Donald Trump,"One of them came out last week, you saw that, “Oh, we’re going to open up on November 9th.” Why November 9th?",,
Donald Trump,Because it’s after the election.,,
Donald Trump,They think they’re hurting us by keeping them closed.,,
Donald Trump,They’re hurting people.,,
Donald Trump,People know what to do.,,
Donald Trump,They can social distance.,,
Donald Trump,"They can wash their hands, they can wear masks.",,
Donald Trump,"They can do whatever they want, but they got to open these states up.",,
Donald Trump,"When you look at North Carolina, when you look, and these governors are under siege, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and a couple of others, you got to open these states up.",,
Donald Trump,It’s not fair.,,
Donald Trump,You’re talking about almost it’s like being in prison.,,
Donald Trump,"And you look at what’s going on with divorce, look at what’s going on with alcoholism and drugs.",,
Donald Trump,"It’s a very, very sad thing.",,
Donald Trump,And he’ll close down the whole country.,,
Donald Trump,This guy will close down the whole country and destroy our country.,,
Donald Trump,"Our country is coming back incredibly well, setting records as it does it.",,
Donald Trump,"We don’t need somebody to come in and say, “Let’s shut it down.”",,
Chris Wallace,All right.,,
Chris Wallace,"Your two minutes, sir.",,
Chris Wallace,We’re now moved to you.,,
Chris Wallace,"As I said, posing the question, the president says it’s a V-shape recovery, you say it’s a K-shaped recovery.",,
Chris Wallace,What’s the difference?,,
Joe Biden,The difference is millionaires and billionaires like him in the middle of the COVID crisis have done very well.,,
Joe Biden,"Billionaires have made another $300 billion because of his profligate tax proposal, and he only focused on the market.",,
Joe Biden,"But you folks at home, you folks living in Scranton and Claymont and all the small towns and working class towns in America, how well are you doing?",,
Joe Biden,This guy paid a total of $750 in taxes.,,
Donald Trump,That’s wrong.,,
Chris Wallace,"Sir, wait.",,
Chris Wallace,No.,,
Chris Wallace,Sir-,,
Donald Trump,[crosstalk 00:12:19].,,
Chris Wallace,"Yeah, I understand.",,
Chris Wallace,"You’ve agreed to the two minutes, so please let him have it.",,
Joe Biden,Do I get my time back?,,
Joe Biden,"The fact is that he has in fact, worked on this in a way that he’s going to be the first president of the United States to leave office, having fewer jobs in his administration than when he became president.",,
Joe Biden,Fewer jobs than when he became president.,,
Joe Biden,First one in American history.,,
Joe Biden,"Secondly, the people who have lost their jobs are those people who have been on the front lines.",,
Joe Biden,"Those people who have been saving our lives, those people who have been out there dying.",,
Joe Biden,People who’ve been putting themselves in the way to make sure that we could all try to make it.,,
Joe Biden,"And the idea that he is insisting that we go forward and open when you have almost half the states in America with a significant increase in COVID deaths and COVID cases in the United States of America, and he wants to open it up more.",,
Joe Biden,Why is he want to open it up?,,
Joe Biden,Why does he take care of the… You can’t fix the economy until you fix the COVID crisis.,,
Joe Biden,And he has no intention of doing anything about making it better for you all at home in terms of your health and your safety.,,
Joe Biden,Schools.,,
Joe Biden,Why aren’t schools open?,,
Joe Biden,Because it costs a lot of money to open them safely.,,
Joe Biden,"They were going to give, his administration going to give the teachers and school students masks, and then they decided no, couldn’t do that because it’s not a national emergency.",,
Joe Biden,Not a national emergency.,,
Joe Biden,They’ve done nothing to help small businesses.,,
Joe Biden,Nothing.,,
Joe Biden,They’re closing.,,
Joe Biden,One in six is now gone.,,
Joe Biden,He ought to get on the job and take care of the needs of the American people so we can open safely.,,
Chris Wallace,All right.,,
Chris Wallace,"Your time is up, sir.",,
Chris Wallace,We are going to get to-,,
Donald Trump,I have to respond to that.,,
Chris Wallace,"Well, you both had two minutes, sir.",,
Donald Trump,"Excuse me, he made a statement.",,
Chris Wallace,And so did you.,,
Donald Trump,"No, people want their schools open.",,
Donald Trump,They don’t want to be shut down.,,
Donald Trump,They don’t want their state shut down.,,
Donald Trump,They want their restaurants.,,
Donald Trump,I look at New York.,,
Donald Trump,It’s so sad what’s happening in New York.,,
Donald Trump,"It’s almost like a ghost town, and I’m not sure it can ever recover what they’ve done to New York.",,
Donald Trump,People want their places open.,,
Donald Trump,They want to get back to their lives.,,
Joe Biden,People want to be safe.,,
Donald Trump,"They’ll be careful, but they want their schools open.",,
Joe Biden,People want to be safe.,,
Donald Trump,I’m the one that brought back football.,,
Donald Trump,"By the way, I brought back Big Ten football.",,
Donald Trump,It was me and I’m very happy to do it-,,
Chris Wallace,All right.,,
Chris Wallace,Let’s-,,
Donald Trump,… and people of Ohio are very proud of me.,,
Donald Trump,And you know how I found out?,,
Donald Trump,When [crosstalk 00:14:35].,,
Chris Wallace,"Gentlemen, we’re going to get to your economic plans going forward in a moment, but first, Mr. President, as you well know, there’s a new report that in 2016, the year you were elected president, and 2017, your first year as president, that you paid $750 a year in federal income tax each of those years.",,
Chris Wallace,"I know that you pay a lot of other taxes, but I’m asking you this specific question.",,
Chris Wallace,Is it true that you paid $750 in federal income taxes each of those two years?,,
Donald Trump,"I paid millions of dollars in taxes, millions of dollars of income tax.",,
Donald Trump,"And let me just tell you, there was a story in one of the papers that paid-",,
Joe Biden,Show us your tax returns.,,
Donald Trump,"I paid $38 million one year, I paid $27 million one year.",,
Joe Biden,Show us your tax returns.,,
Donald Trump,"You’ll see it as soon as it’s finished, you’ll see it.",,
Donald Trump,"You know, if you wanted to, go to the Board of Elections.",,
Donald Trump,"There’s 118 page or so report that says everything I have, every bank I have, I’m totally under leveraged because the assets are extremely good, and I built a great company.",,
Chris Wallace,"Sir, I’m asking you a specific question, which is-",,
Donald Trump,But let me tell you-,,
Chris Wallace,I understand all of that.,,
Joe Biden,Release your tax return.,,
Chris Wallace,I understand all of that-,,
Donald Trump,Let me-,,
Chris Wallace,"No, Mr. President, I’m asking you a question.",,
Chris Wallace,Will you tell us how much you paid in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017?,,
Donald Trump,Millions of dollars.,,
Chris Wallace,You paid millions of dollars in-,,
Donald Trump,"Millions of dollars, yes.",,
Chris Wallace,So not 750?,,
Donald Trump,Millions of dollars.,,
Donald Trump,And you’ll get to see it.,,
Donald Trump,And you’ll get to see it.,,
Joe Biden,When?,,
Donald Trump,But let me just tell you-,,
Joe Biden,In [crosstalk 00:16:04]?,,
Donald Trump,"Chris, let me just say something, that it was the tax laws.",,
Donald Trump,I don’t want to pay tax.,,
Donald Trump,"Before I came here, I was a private developer, I was a private business people.",,
Donald Trump,"Like every other private person, unless they’re stupid, they go through the laws, and that’s what it is.",,
Donald Trump,He passed a tax bill that gave us all these privileges for depreciation and for tax credits.,,
Donald Trump,"We build the building and we get tax credits, like the hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue.",,
Donald Trump,"Which by the way, was given to me by the Obama administration, if you can believe that.",,
Donald Trump,"Now the man got fired right after that happened, but that’s-",,
Chris Wallace,"Vice President Biden, you want to respond?",,
Joe Biden,"Yeah, I do want to respond.",,
Joe Biden,"Look, the tax code that put him in a position that he pays less tax than on the money a school teacher makes is because of him… He says he’s smart because he can take advantage of the tax code.",,
Joe Biden,And he does take advantage of the tax code.,,
Joe Biden,That’s why I’m going to eliminate the Trump tax cuts.,,
Joe Biden,And I’m going to eliminate those tax cuts.,,
Donald Trump,That’s okay.,,
Joe Biden,And make sure that we invest in the people who in fact need the help.,,
Joe Biden,People out there need help.,,
Donald Trump,But why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?,,
Joe Biden,Because you weren’t president-,,
Donald Trump,Why didn’t you do it over the last 25 years?,,
Joe Biden,Because you weren’t president and screwing things up.,,
Donald Trump,You were a Senator and [crosstalk 00:17:21]-,,
Joe Biden,You’re the worst president America has ever had.,,
Joe Biden,Come on.,,
Donald Trump,"Hey, Joe, let me just tell you, Joe.",,
Donald Trump,"In 47 months, I’ve done more than you’ve done in 47 years, Joe.",,
Donald Trump,We’ve done things that you never even thought of doing.,,
Chris Wallace,Okay.,,
Chris Wallace,Gentlemen?,,
Donald Trump,"Including fixing the broken military that you gave me, including taking care of your debts.",,
Chris Wallace,"Mr. President, we’re talking about the economy.",,
Chris Wallace,"I’d like to ask you about your plans going forward because Mr. Vice President, your economic plan-",,
Donald Trump,He has none.,,
Chris Wallace,"… if you were to be elected president focuses a lot on big government, big taxes, big spending.",,
Chris Wallace,I want to focus first on the taxes.,,
Chris Wallace,"You propose more than $4 trillion over a decade in new taxes on individuals making more than $400,000 a year.",,
Chris Wallace,"… on individuals making more than $400,000 a year and on corporations.",,
Chris Wallace,President Trump says that that kind of an increase in taxes is going to hurt the economy as it’s just coming out of a recession.,,
Joe Biden,"Well, just take a look at what is the analysis done by Wall Street firms, points out that my economic plan would create 7 million more jobs than his in four years, number one.",,
Joe Biden,"And number two, it would create an additional $1 trillion in economic growth, because it would be about buying American.",,
Joe Biden,"The federal government spends $600 billion a year on everything from ships, to steel, to buildings and the like.",,
Joe Biden,"And under my proposal, we’re going to make sure that every penny of that has to be made by a company-",,
Chris Wallace,"But respectfully, sir, I’m talking about taxes, not spending.",,
Joe Biden,"By the way, I’m going to eliminate a significant number of the taxes.",,
Joe Biden,I’m going to make the corporate tax 28%.,,
Joe Biden,It shouldn’t be 21%.,,
Joe Biden,"You have 91 companies federal, I mean, the fortune 500, who don’t pay a single penny in tax making billions of dollars.",,
Donald Trump,"Why didn’t you do it before, when you were vice president with Obama?",,
Joe Biden,"Because you in fact passed that, that was your tax proposal.",,
Donald Trump,I got it done.,,
Donald Trump,And you know what happened?,,
Joe Biden,"Yeah, you got it done-",,
Donald Trump,Our economy boomed like it’s never boomed before.,,
Joe Biden,The economy-,,
Chris Wallace,Mr. President-,,
Joe Biden,Let me finish.,,
Chris Wallace,"Mr. President, let me pick up on that.",,
Chris Wallace,"You would continue your free market approach, lower taxes, more deregulation, correct?",,
Joe Biden,Not lower tax for the American people.,,
Chris Wallace,But let me-,,
Donald Trump,Excuse me.,,
Chris Wallace,You talk about the economy booming.,,
Chris Wallace,"It turns out that in Obama’s final three years as president more jobs were created, a million and a half more jobs, than in the first three years of your presidency.",,
Donald Trump,They had the slowest economic recovery since 1929.,,
Donald Trump,It was the slowest recovery.,,
Donald Trump,"Also, they took over something that was down here.",,
Donald Trump,All you had to do is turn on the lights and you pick up a lot.,,
Donald Trump,"But they had the slowest economic recovery since 1929, and let me tell you about the stock market.",,
Donald Trump,"When the stock market goes up, that means jobs.",,
Donald Trump,It also means 401ks.,,
Donald Trump,"If you got in, if you ever became president with your ideas, you want to terminate my taxes.",,
Donald Trump,"I’ll tell you what, you’ll lose.",,
Donald Trump,Half of the companies that have poured in here will leave.,,
Donald Trump,"And plenty of companies that are already here, they’ll leave for other places.",,
Donald Trump,"[crosstalk 00:20:25] They will leave and you will have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen.",,
Joe Biden,Look-,,
Chris Wallace,Mr. Vice President.,,
Joe Biden,"… we inherited the worst recession, short of a depression in American history.",,
Joe Biden,I was asked to bring it back.,,
Joe Biden,We were able to have an economic recovery that created the jobs you’re talking about.,,
Joe Biden,"We handed him a booming economy, he blew it.",,
Donald Trump,It wasn’t blooming.,,
Joe Biden,He blew it.,,
Donald Trump,He was in booming.,,
Donald Trump,It was the weakest recovery since 1929.,,
Chris Wallace,"Wait, wait, is it fair to say he blew it when, in fact-",,
Donald Trump,When COVID came along.,,
Chris Wallace,… when there was record low unemployment before COVID.,,
Joe Biden,"Yeah, because what he did, even before COVID, manufacturing went in the hole.",,
Joe Biden,Manufacturing went in a hole-,,
Donald Trump,"Excuse me, Chris, wait.",,
Joe Biden,… number one.,,
Joe Biden,Number two-,,
Donald Trump,Chris.,,
Joe Biden,Number three.,,
Donald Trump,"They said it would take… No, you’re on number two.",,
Joe Biden,No.,,
Donald Trump,"Chris, Chris.",,
Donald Trump,They said it would take-,,
Joe Biden,This guy-,,
Donald Trump,… a miracle to bring back manufacturing.,,
Donald Trump,"I brought back 700,000 jobs.",,
Donald Trump,They brought back nothing.,,
Donald Trump,They gave up on manufacturing.,,
Joe Biden,We did not.,,
Joe Biden,[crosstalk 00:21:21],,
Donald Trump,… standard fare.,,
Joe Biden,I’m the guy that brought back the automobile industry.,,
Donald Trump,He totally gave up on manufacturing.,,
Chris Wallace,"All right, let him-",,
Joe Biden,I was asked to bring back Chrysler and General Motors.,,
Joe Biden,He brought them back right here in the state of Ohio and Michigan.,,
Joe Biden,He blew it.,,
Joe Biden,They’re gone.,,
Joe Biden,He blew it.,,
Joe Biden,"And in fact, they’re gone-",,
Donald Trump,Ohio had the best year it’s ever had last year.,,
Donald Trump,Michigan had the best year they’ve ever had.,,
Joe Biden,That is not true.,,
Donald Trump,"Many car companies came in from Germany, from Japan, went to Michigan, went to Ohio and they didn’t come in with you.",,
Donald Trump,[crosstalk 00:21:47].,,
Chris Wallace,"Mr. Vice President, go ahead.",,
Joe Biden,And so you take a look at what he’s actually done.,,
Joe Biden,He’s done very little.,,
Joe Biden,His trade deals are the same way.,,
Joe Biden,He talks about these great trade deals.,,
Joe Biden,He talks about the art of the deal.,,
Joe Biden,China’s perfected the art of the steel.,,
Joe Biden,We have a higher deficit with China now than we did before.,,
Joe Biden,We have the highest trade deficit-,,
Donald Trump,China ate your lunch- [crosstalk 00:00:22:07].,,
Joe Biden,… with Mexico.,,
Donald Trump,"China ate your lunch, Joe.",,
Donald Trump,And no wonder your son goes in and he takes out billions of dollars.,,
Donald Trump,He takes out billions of dollars to manage.,,
Donald Trump,He makes millions of dollars.,,
Donald Trump,"And also, while we’re at it, why is it just out of curiosity, the mayor of Moscow’s wife gave you a son three and a half million dollars?",,
Joe Biden,That is not true.,,
Donald Trump,What did he do to deserve it?,,
Donald Trump,What did he do with-,,
Joe Biden,None of that is true.,,
Donald Trump,"… to deserve $183,000?",,
Chris Wallace,"Sir, you’ve asked him a question, let him answer it.",,
Joe Biden,None of that is true.,,
Donald Trump,"Oh really, he didn’t get three and a half million?",,
Chris Wallace,Mr. President-,,
Joe Biden,Is totally-,,
Chris Wallace,"Mr. President, please.",,
Chris Wallace,You’ve asked a question- [crosstalk 00:22:41],,
Joe Biden,Totally discredited.,,
Joe Biden,Totally discredited.,,
Joe Biden,And by the way-,,
Donald Trump,"Well wait, he didn’t get three and a half million dollars, Joe?",,
Joe Biden,Mr. Vice-,,
Donald Trump,He got three and a half million-,,
Chris Wallace,Mr. President.,,
Donald Trump,… dollars.,,
Joe Biden,That is not true.,,
Donald Trump,"Oh, really?",,
Chris Wallace,"Mr. President, it’s an open discussion.",,
Chris Wallace,Please- [crosstalk 00:22:56],,
Donald Trump,It’s a fact.,,
Joe Biden,It is not a fact.,,
Chris Wallace,"Well, you have raised an issue, let the Vice President answer.",,
Joe Biden,It’s been totally discredited.,,
Donald Trump,"Did Burisma pay him 183,000 a month, with no experience in energy?",,
Chris Wallace,Mr. President-,,
Joe Biden,My son did nothing wrong at Barisma-,,
Donald Trump,I think he did.,,
Chris Wallace,"Mr. President, let him answer.",,
Chris Wallace,[crosstalk 00:23:13].,,
Joe Biden,"He doesn’t want to let me answer, because he knows I have the truth.",,
Joe Biden,His position has been totally thoroughly discredited-,,
Donald Trump,By who?,,
Joe Biden,And you can-,,
Donald Trump,The media.,,
Joe Biden,by everybody.,,
Joe Biden,"Well, by the media, by our allies.",,
Donald Trump,"By the media, because they refuse to talk about it-",,
Joe Biden,By the World Bank-,,
Donald Trump,… because they’re embarrassed.,,
Joe Biden,"By everyone, has discredited.",,
Joe Biden,And matter of fact [crosstalk 00:23:30] Matter of fact-,,
Chris Wallace,"Mr. President, please stop.",,
Joe Biden,Even the people who testified under oath-,,
Donald Trump,"So let me ask you this, Joe- [crosstalk 00:23:35].",,
Chris Wallace,"Go ahead, I’m listening to you.",,
Joe Biden,Even the people under-,,
Donald Trump,He got three and a half million dollars from Moscow.,,
Joe Biden,… testified under oath in his administration said I did my job and I did it very well.,,
Donald Trump,"Oh, really?",,
Joe Biden,I did it honorably.,,
Donald Trump,I’d like to know who they are.,,
Joe Biden,"Well, I’ll give you the list of the people who-",,
Donald Trump,I’ll fire them.,,
Chris Wallace,"No, no.",,
Chris Wallace,"Go ahead, sir.",,
Joe Biden,"I’m sure that you’ve already fired most of them, because they did a good job.",,
Donald Trump,Some people don’t do a good job.,,
Joe Biden,"Well, here’s the- [crosstalk 00:23:57]",,
Chris Wallace,Go ahead.,,
Chris Wallace,You get the- [crosstalk 00:23:57] Wait a minute.,,
Chris Wallace,"You get the final word, Mr.-",,
Joe Biden,"Well, it’s hard to get any word in with this clown.",,
Joe Biden,"Excuse me, this person.",,
Donald Trump,"Hey, let me just tell you, Joe-",,
Joe Biden,"No, no.",,
Joe Biden,Mr. President- [crosstalk 00:24:05],,
Donald Trump,"Three and a half million, Joe.",,
Joe Biden,That is simply not true.,,
Donald Trump,Why did he deserve three and a half million from Moscow?,,
Joe Biden,"Look, here’s the deal.",,
Joe Biden,We want to talk about families and ethics.,,
Joe Biden,I don’t want to do that.,,
Joe Biden,"I mean, his family, we could talk about all night.",,
Joe Biden,His family’s already-,,
Donald Trump,My family-,,
Chris Wallace,"No, no- [crosstalk 00:06:20].",,
Donald Trump,My family lost a fortune by coming down and helping us with governance.,,
Joe Biden,And that’s such a- [crosstalk 00:24:25],,
Chris Wallace,Mr. President-,,
Donald Trump,Every single one of them lost a fortune-,,
Joe Biden,This is not about my family or his family.,,
Joe Biden,"It’s about your family, the American people.",,
Joe Biden,[crosstalk 00:24:32] That’s not true.,,
Joe Biden,It doesn’t want to talk about what you need.,,
Joe Biden,"You, the American people, it’s about you.",,
Joe Biden,That’s what we’re talking about here.,,
Joe Biden,[crosstalk 00:24:42],,
Chris Wallace,That’s the end of the segment.,,
Chris Wallace,We’re moving on.,,
Joe Biden,He didn’t take that.,,
Chris Wallace,Vice President-,,
Donald Trump,"Chris, can I be honest?",,
Donald Trump,It’s a very important question-,,
Joe Biden,Try to be honest.,,
Chris Wallace,No.,,
Donald Trump,He stood up-,,
Chris Wallace,The answer to the question is no.,,
Donald Trump,… and the threatened Ukraine-,,
Chris Wallace,Sir-,,
Donald Trump,… with a billion dollars-,,
Joe Biden,That is absolutely not true.,,
Chris Wallace,Stop.,,
Chris Wallace,"[crosstalk 00:25:02] Gentlemen, I hate to raise my voice, but I- [crosstalk 00:25:05] Why should I be different than the two of you?",,
Chris Wallace,So here’s the deal.,,
Joe Biden,That’s a good point.,,
Chris Wallace,We have six segments.,,
Chris Wallace,We have ended that segment.,,
Chris Wallace,We’re going to go to the next segment.,,
Chris Wallace,"In that segment, you each are going to have two uninterrupted moments.",,
Chris Wallace,"In those two interrupted minutes, Mr. President, you can say anything you want.",,
Chris Wallace,"I’m going to ask a question about race, but if you want to answer about something else, go ahead.",,
Chris Wallace,"But I think that the country would be better served, if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions.",,
Chris Wallace,"I’m appealing to you, sir, to do that.",,
Donald Trump,"Well, and him too.",,
Chris Wallace,"Well, frankly, you’ve been doing more interrupting than he has.",,
Donald Trump,"Well, that’s all right, but he does plenty.",,
Chris Wallace,"Well, sir, less than-",,
Donald Trump,He does plenty.,,
Chris Wallace,"No, less than you have.",,
Chris Wallace,Let’s please continue on.,,
Chris Wallace,The issue of rice.,,
Chris Wallace,"Vice-President Biden, you say that President Trump’s response to the violence in Charlottesville three years ago, when he talked about very fine people on both sides, was what directly led you to launch this run for president.",,
Donald Trump,"Oh yeah, sure.",,
Chris Wallace,"President Trump, you have often said that you believe you will have done more for Black Americans than any president with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln.",,
Donald Trump,That’s true.,,
Chris Wallace,"My question for the two of you, is why should voters trust you rather than your opponent to deal with the race issues facing this country over the next four years?",,
Chris Wallace,"Vice President Biden, you go first.",,
Joe Biden,It’s about equity and equality.,,
Joe Biden,It’s about decency.,,
Joe Biden,It’s about the constitution.,,
Joe Biden,"And we have never walked away from trying to require equity for everyone, equality for the whole of America.",,
Joe Biden,"But we’ve never accomplished it, but we’ve never walked away from it like he has done.",,
Joe Biden,"It is true, the reason I got in the race is when those people… Close your eyes, remember what those people look like coming out of the fields, carrying torches, their veins bulging, just spewing anti-Semitic bile and accompanied by the Ku Klux Klan.",,
Joe Biden,A young woman got killed and they asked the president what he thought.,,
Joe Biden,"He said, “There were very fine people on both sides.” No president’s ever said anything like that.",,
Joe Biden,[crosstalk 00:27:10].,,
Chris Wallace,It is his-,,
Joe Biden,Now-,,
Chris Wallace,… minute sir.,,
Joe Biden,"… second point I’d make to you, is that when Floyd was killed, when Mr. Floyd was killed, there was a peaceful protest in front of the White House.",,
Joe Biden,What did he do?,,
Joe Biden,"He came out of his bunker, had the military use tear gas on them so he could walk across to a church and hold up a Bible.",,
Joe Biden,And then what happened after that?,,
Joe Biden,The Bishop of that very church said that it was a disgrace.,,
Joe Biden,"The general who was with him said all he ever wants to do is divide people, not unite people at all.",,
Joe Biden,"This is a president who has used everything as a dog whistle, to try to generate racists hatred, racist division.",,
Joe Biden,"This is a man who, in fact, you talk about helping African-Americans, one in 1000 African Americans has been killed because of the coronavirus.",,
Joe Biden,"And if he doesn’t do something quickly, by the end of the year, one in 500 will have been killed.",,
Joe Biden,One in 500 African Americans.,,
Joe Biden,This man is as a savior of African-Americans?,,
Joe Biden,This man cares at all?,,
Joe Biden,This man’s done virtually nothing.,,
Joe Biden,"Look, the fact is that you have to look at what he talks about.",,
Joe Biden,You have to look at what he did.,,
Joe Biden,And what he did has been disastrous for the African-American community.,,
Donald Trump,So-,,
Chris Wallace,"President Trump, you have two minutes.",,
Chris Wallace,Why should Americans trust you over your opponent to deal race issues?,,
Donald Trump,"You did a crime bill, 1994, where you call them super predators.",,
Donald Trump,African-Americans are super predators and they’ve never forgotten it.,,
Donald Trump,They’ve never forgotten it.,,
Joe Biden,I’ve never said-,,
Chris Wallace,"No, no, sir.",,
Chris Wallace,It’s his two minutes.,,
Donald Trump,"So you did that and they call you a super predator and I’m letting people out of jail now, that you have treated the African-American population community, you have treated the black community about as bad as anybody in this country.",,
Donald Trump,"You did the 1990… And that’s why, if you look at the polls, I’m doing better than any Republican has done in a long time, because they saw what you did.",,
Donald Trump,"You call them super predators, and you’ve called them worse than that.",,
Donald Trump,"Because you look back at your testimony over the years, you’ve called them a lot worse than that.",,
Donald Trump,"As far as the church is concerned and as far as the generals are concerned, we just got the support of 250 military leaders and generals, total support.",,
Donald Trump,"Law enforcement, almost every law enforcement group in the United States.",,
Donald Trump,I have Florida.,,
Donald Trump,I have Texas.,,
Donald Trump,I have Ohio.,,
Donald Trump,"I have every… Excuse me, Portland, the sheriff just came out today and he said, “I support President Trump.”",,
Donald Trump,I don’t think you have any law enforcement.,,
Donald Trump,You can’t even say the word law enforcement.,,
Donald Trump,"Because if you say those words, you’re going to lose all of your radical left supporters.",,
Donald Trump,"And why aren’t you saying those words, Joe?",,
Donald Trump,Why don’t you say the words law enforcement?,,
Donald Trump,Because you know what?,,
Donald Trump,"If called us in Portland, we would put out that fire in a half an hour.",,
Donald Trump,"But they won’t do it, because they’re run by radical left Democrats.",,
Donald Trump,"If you look at Chicago, if you look at any place you want to look, Seattle, they heard we were coming in the following day and they put up their hands and we got back Seattle.",,
Donald Trump,"Minneapolis, we got it back, Joe, because we believe in law and order, but you don’t.",,
Donald Trump,"The top 10 cities and just about the top 40 cities are run by Democrats, and in many cases radical left.",,
Donald Trump,"And they’ve got you wrapped around their finger, Joe, to a point where you don’t want to say anything about law and order.",,
Donald Trump,"And I’ll tell you what, the people of this country want and demand law and order and you’re afraid to even say it.",,
Chris Wallace,All right.,,
Chris Wallace,I want to return to the question of race.,,
Chris Wallace,"Vice President Biden, after the grand jury in the Breonna Taylor case decided not to charge any of the police with homicide, you said it raises the question, “Whether justice could be equally applied in America.” Do you believe that there is a separate but unequal system of justice for Blacks in this country?",,
Joe Biden,"Yes, there is.",,
Joe Biden,"There’s systemic injustice in this country, in education and work and in law enforcement and the way in which it’s enforced.",,
Joe Biden,"But look, the vast majority of police officers are good, decent, honorable men and women.",,
Joe Biden,"They risk their lives every day to take care of us, but there are some bad apples.",,
Joe Biden,"And when they occur, when they find them, they have to be sorted out.",,
Joe Biden,They have to be held accountable.,,
Joe Biden,They have to be held accountable.,,
Joe Biden,"And what I’m going to do as President of the United States is call together an entire group of people at the White House, everything from the civil rights groups, to the police officers, to the police chiefs, and we’re going to work this out.",,
Joe Biden,We’re going to work this out.,,
Joe Biden,"So we changed the way in which we have more transparency, in when these things happen.",,
Joe Biden,These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to George Floyd.,,
Joe Biden,These cops aren’t happy to see what happened to Breonna Taylor.,,
Joe Biden,"Most don’t like it, but we have to have a system where people are held accountable when… And by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate.",,
Joe Biden,"Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate.",,
Chris Wallace,"All right, Mr.-",,
Donald Trump,What is peaceful protest?,,
Donald Trump,When they run through the middle of the town-,,
Chris Wallace,President Trump-,,
Donald Trump,… and burn down your stores and kill people all over the place- [crosstalk 00:32:14].,,
Joe Biden,That is not peaceful protest.,,
Donald Trump,"No it’s not, but you say it is.",,
Chris Wallace,"President Trump, I’d like to continue with the issue of race.",,
Chris Wallace,I promise we’re going to get to the issue of law and order in a moment.,,
Donald Trump,Fine.,,
Chris Wallace,"This month, your administration directed federal agencies to end racial sensitivity training that addresses white privilege or critical race theory.",,
Chris Wallace,"Why did you decide to do that, to end racial sensitivity training?",,
Chris Wallace,"And do you believe that there is systemic racism in this country, sir?",,
Donald Trump,I ended it because it’s racist.,,
Donald Trump,I ended it because a lot of people were complaining that they were asked to do things that were absolutely insane.,,
Donald Trump,"That it a radical revolution that was taking place in our military, in our schools, all over the place.",,
Donald Trump,"And you know it, and so does everybody else.",,
Donald Trump,And he would know it- [crosstalk 00:33:02],,
Chris Wallace,What is radical about racial sensitivity training?,,
Donald Trump,"If you were a certain person, you had no status in life.",,
Donald Trump,It was sort of a reversal.,,
Donald Trump,"And if you look at the people, we were paying people hundreds of thousands of dollars to teach very bad ideas and frankly, very sick ideas.",,
Donald Trump,"And really, they were teaching people to hate our country And I’m not going to do that.",,
Donald Trump,I’m not going to allow that to happen.,,
Donald Trump,We have to go back to the core values of this country.,,
Donald Trump,They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place.,,
Donald Trump,It’s a racist place.,,
Donald Trump,And they were teaching people to hate our country.,,
Donald Trump,And I’m not going to allow that to happen.,,
Chris Wallace,Vice President Biden.,,
Joe Biden,Nobody’s doing that.,,
Joe Biden,He’s the racist.,,
Donald Trump,You just don’t know.,,
Joe Biden,Here’s the deal.,,
Joe Biden,I know a lot more about this- [crosstalk 00:15:43].,,
Chris Wallace,Let him finish.,,
Joe Biden,The fact is that there is racial insensitivity.,,
Joe Biden,"People have to be made aware of what other people feel like, what insults them, what is demeaning to them.",,
Joe Biden,It’s important people know.,,
Joe Biden,"Many people don’t want to hurt other people’s feelings, but it makes a big difference.",,
Joe Biden,It makes a gigantic difference in the way a child is able to grow up and have a sense of self-esteem.,,
Joe Biden,It’s a little bit like how this guy and his friends look down on so many people.,,
Joe Biden,"They look down their nose on people like Irish Catholics, like me, who grow up in Scranton.",,
Joe Biden,They look down on people who don’t have money.,,
Joe Biden,They look down on people who are of a different faith.,,
Joe Biden,They looked down on people who are a different color.,,
Joe Biden,"In fact, we’re all Americans.",,
Joe Biden,The only way we’re going to bring this country together is bring everybody together.,,
Joe Biden,"There’s nothing we cannot do, if we do it together.",,
Joe Biden,We can take this on and we can defeat racism in American.,,
Chris Wallace,"Vice President… I mean, President Trump, sir.",,
Donald Trump,"During the Obama-Biden administration, there was tremendous division.",,
Donald Trump,There was hatred.,,
Donald Trump,"You look at Ferguson, you look at, or you go to very… Many places, look at Oakland.",,
Donald Trump,Look what happened in Oakland.,,
Donald Trump,Look what happened in Baltimore.,,
Donald Trump,"Look what happened… Frankly, it was more violent than what I’m even seeing now.",,
Joe Biden,Oh my Lord.,,
Donald Trump,But the reason-,,
Joe Biden,This is ridiculous.,,
Donald Trump,… is that the Democrats that run these cities-,,
Joe Biden,Absolutely ridiculous.,,
Donald Trump,"… don’t want to talk, like you, about law and order.",,
Joe Biden,Violent crime-,,
Donald Trump,And you still haven’t mentioned.,,
Donald Trump,Are you in favor of law and order?,,
Joe Biden,I’m in favor of law.,,
Joe Biden,You- [crosstalk 00:35:15].,,
Donald Trump,Are you in favor of law and order?,,
Donald Trump,[crosstalk 00:35:17],,
Chris Wallace,"You asked a question, let him finish.",,
Chris Wallace,[crosstalk 00:35:18] Let him answer.,,
Joe Biden,"Law and order with justice, where people get treated fairly.",,
Donald Trump,Okay.,,
Joe Biden,"And the fact of the matter is, violent crime went down 17%, 15% in our administration.",,
Joe Biden,It’s gone up on his watch.,,
Donald Trump,It went down much more in ours.,,
Chris Wallace,"All right, we’re done- [crosstalk 00:35:35] Mr. President, you’re going to be very happy because we’re now going to talk about law and order.",,
Donald Trump,The places we had trouble were democratic run cities-,,
Chris Wallace,That’s exactly my question.,,
Chris Wallace,"There has been a dramatic increase in homicides in America this summer particularly, and you often blame that on democratic mayors and democratic governors.",,
Chris Wallace,"But in fact, there have been equivalent spikes in Republican led cities, like Tulsa and Fort Worth.",,
Chris Wallace,"So the question is, is this really a…",,
Chris Wallace,It’s like Tulsa and Fort worth.,,
Chris Wallace,"So the question is, is this really a party issue?",,
Donald Trump,"I think as a party issue, you can bring in a couple of examples but if you look at Chicago, what’s going on in Chicago where a 53 people were shot and eight died shot, if you look at New York where it’s going up, like nobody’s ever seen anything.",,
Donald Trump,"The numbers are going up a 100%, 150%, 200% crime, it is crazy what’s going on and he doesn’t want to say law and order because he can’t because he’ll lose his radical left supporters and once he does that, it’s over with.",,
Donald Trump,"But if he ever got to run this country and they ran it the way he would want to run it, we would have by the way our suburbs would be gone.",,
Donald Trump,And you would see problems like you’ve never seen before.,,
Joe Biden,He wouldn’t know a suburb unless you took a wrong turn.,,
Donald Trump,"Oh, I know suburbs so much that you.",,
Chris Wallace,Gentlemen wait a minute.,,
Joe Biden,I was raised in the suburbs.,,
Joe Biden,This is not 1950.,,
Joe Biden,All these dog whistles and racism don’t work anymore.,,
Joe Biden,Suburbs are by and large integrated.,,
Joe Biden,"There’s many people today driving their kids to soccer practice and/or black and white and Hispanic in the same car as there have been any time in the past, what really is a threat to the suburbs and their safety is his failure to deal with COVID.",,
Joe Biden,They’re dying in the suburbs.,,
Joe Biden,"His failure to deal with the environment, they’re being flooded, they’re being burned out because his refusal to do anything.",,
Joe Biden,That’s why the suburbs are in trouble.,,
Chris Wallace,I do want to talk about this issue of law and order though.,,
Chris Wallace,"And in the joint recommendation that came from the Biden-Bernie Sanders task force, you talked about quote re-imagining policing.",,
Chris Wallace,"First of all, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support?",,
Chris Wallace,"If I might finish the question, what does re-imagining policing mean and do you support the Black Lives Matter call for community control of policing?",,
Joe Biden,"Look, what I support are the police having the opportunity to deal with the problems they face and I’m totally opposed to defunding the police offices.",,
Joe Biden,"As a matter of fact police, local police, the only one defunding in his budget calls for a $400 million cut in local law enforcement assistance.",,
Joe Biden,They need more assistance.,,
Joe Biden,They need when they show up for a 9-11 call to have someone with them as a psychologist or psychiatrist to keep them from having to use force and be able to talk people down.,,
Joe Biden,We have to have community policing like we had before where the officers get to know the people in the communities.,,
Joe Biden,"That’s when crime went down, it didn’t go up.",,
Joe Biden,It went down.,,
Joe Biden,And so we have to be…,,
Donald Trump,That’s not what they are talking about this.,,
Donald Trump,That’s not what it is about.,,
Donald Trump,He’s talking about defunding the police.,,
Joe Biden,That is not true.,,
Donald Trump,He doesn’t have any law support.,,
Donald Trump,He has no law enforcement.,,
Joe Biden,That’s not true.,,
Donald Trump,He has almost nothing.,,
Donald Trump,"Oh, really, who do you have name one group that supports you name one group that came out and supported you.",,
Donald Trump,Go ahead.,,
Donald Trump,Think we have time.,,
Joe Biden,We don’t have time to do anything.,,
Donald Trump,"No, no think right now.",,
Donald Trump,Name one law enforcement group that came out in support of you.,,
Chris Wallace,"Now, gentleman.",,
Chris Wallace,I think I’m going to tell I’m going to take back the bottom line.,,
Donald Trump,There aren’t any.,,
Chris Wallace,"And I want to get to another subject, which is the issue of protests in many cities that have turned violent in Portland, Oregon, especially we had more than a 100 straight days of protests, which I think you would agree, you talk about peaceful protests.",,
Chris Wallace,Many of those turned into riots.,,
Chris Wallace,Mr.,,
Chris Wallace,Vice-president you say that people who commit crimes should be held accountable.,,
Chris Wallace,"The question I have though is as the democratic nominee, and earlier tonight, you said that you are the Democratic Party right now, have you ever called the Democratic Mayor of Portland or the Democratic Governor of Oregon and said, “Hey, you got to stop this, bring in the National Guard, do whatever it takes, but you’d stop the days and months of violence in Portland.”",,
Joe Biden,I don’t hold public office.,,
Joe Biden,Now I am a former vice president.,,
Joe Biden,I’ve made it clear.,,
Joe Biden,I’ve made it clear in my public statements that the violence should be prosecuted.,,
Joe Biden,It should be prosecuted and anyone who committed it should be prosecuted.,,
Chris Wallace,But you’ve never called for the people…,,
Donald Trump,He’s never done that.,,
Chris Wallace,"Excuse me, sir.",,
Chris Wallace,You had never called for the leaders in Portland and in Oregon to call and bring in the National Guard and knock off a 100 days of riots.,,
Joe Biden,They can in fact take care of it if he just stay out of the way.,,
Donald Trump,Oh really?,,
Donald Trump,I sent in the US Marshalls to get the killer of a young man in the middle of the street and they shot him for three days Portland didn’t do anything.,,
Donald Trump,I sent in the US Marshals they took care of business.,,
Chris Wallace,Go ahead sir.,,
Joe Biden,"And by the way his own former spokesperson said, “Riots and chaos and violence help he cause.” That’s what this is all about.",,
Donald Trump,I don’t know who said that.,,
Joe Biden,I do.,,
Donald Trump,Who?,,
Joe Biden,I think Kellyanne Conway.,,
Donald Trump,I don’t think she said that.,,
Joe Biden,She said that.,,
Donald Trump,I don’t think so.,,
Joe Biden,"Here’s the point, the point is that that’s why he keeps trying to rile everything up.",,
Joe Biden,"He doesn’t want to calm things down instead of going in and talking to people and saying, “Let’s get everybody together.",,
Joe Biden,Figure out how to deal with this.” What’s he do?,,
Joe Biden,He just pours gasoline in the fire constantly and every single solitary time.,,
Chris Wallace,Okay.,,
Chris Wallace,"And to end this, button up this segment I’m going to give you a minute to answer, sir.",,
Chris Wallace,You have repeatedly criticized…,,
Donald Trump,Does it mean I have to answer his stuff.,,
Chris Wallace,You have repeatedly…,,
Donald Trump,"Wait a second, you have made a statement.",,
Chris Wallace,You’ve been talking back and forth.,,
Chris Wallace,I’m asking you.,,
Donald Trump,I would love to end it.,,
Chris Wallace,You know sir if you want to switch seats we could very quickly can do that.,,
Donald Trump,"I’ll send in the National Guard, it would be over.",,
Donald Trump,That’d be no problem.,,
Donald Trump,But I don’t want to accept the National Guard.,,
Chris Wallace,You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left wing extremist groups.,,
Chris Wallace,But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia group and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland.,,
Donald Trump,"Sure, I’m will to do that.",,
Chris Wallace,Are you prepared specifically to do it.,,
Donald Trump,I would say almost everything I see is from the left wing not from the right wing.,,
Chris Wallace,But what are you saying?,,
Donald Trump,I’m willing to do anything.,,
Donald Trump,I want to see peace.,,
Chris Wallace,"Well, do it, sir.",,
Joe Biden,"Say it, do it say it.",,
Donald Trump,What do you want to call them?,,
Donald Trump,"Give me a name, give me a name, go ahead who do you want me to condemn.",,
Chris Wallace,White supremacist and right-wing militia.,,
Donald Trump,"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.",,
Donald Trump,But I’ll tell you what somebody’s got to do something about Antifa and the left because this is not a right wing problem this is a left wing.,,
Joe Biden,"He’s own FBI Director said unlike white supremacist, Antifa is an idea not an organization-",,
Donald Trump,Oh you got to be kidding me.,,
Joe Biden,… not a militia.,,
Joe Biden,That’s what his FBI Director said.,,
Donald Trump,"Well, then you know what, he’s wrong.",,
Chris Wallace,"We’re done, sir.",,
Chris Wallace,Moving onto the next… [crosstalk 00:42:46],,
Donald Trump,Antifa is bad.,,
Joe Biden,"Every body in your administration tells you the true, it’s a bad idea.",,
Joe Biden,You have no idea about anything.,,
Donald Trump,"You know what, Antifa is a dangerous radical group.",,
Chris Wallace,"All right, gentlemen we’re now moving onto the Trump-Biden record.",,
Donald Trump,"And you ought to be careful of them, they’ll over throw you.",,
Chris Wallace,I’m going to ask a question.,,
Chris Wallace,"When the president seeks a second term, it is generally a referendum on his record but vice president Biden, you’d like to quote one of your dad’s sayings, which is don’t compare me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative.",,
Chris Wallace,And in this case sir you are the alternative.,,
Chris Wallace,"Looking at both of your records, I’m going to ask each of you.",,
Chris Wallace,"Why should voters elect you president over your opponent in this segment, President Trump you’ll go first, two minutes.",,
Donald Trump,Because there is never been an administration or president who has done more than I’ve done in a period of three and a half years.,,
Donald Trump,"And that’s despite the impeachment hoax and you so what happened today with Hillary Clinton, where it was a whole big con job.",,
Donald Trump,"But despite going through all of these things where I had a fight, both flanks and behind me and above there has never been an administration that’s done what I’ve done.",,
Donald Trump,"The greatest, before COVID came in the greatest economy in history, lowest unemployment numbers, everything was good.",,
Donald Trump,Everything was going.,,
Donald Trump,"And by the way, there was unity going to happen.",,
Donald Trump,"People were calling me for the first time in years, they were calling and they were saying it’s time maybe and then what happened?",,
Donald Trump,We got hit.,,
Donald Trump,But now we’re building it back up again.,,
Donald Trump,"A rebuilding of the military, including Space Force and all of the other things.",,
Donald Trump,"A fixing of the VA which was a mess under him, 308,000 people died because they didn’t have proper health care.",,
Donald Trump,It was a mess.,,
Donald Trump,"And we now got a 91% approval rating at the VA, our vets.",,
Donald Trump,We take care of our vets.,,
Donald Trump,But we’ve rebuilt our military.,,
Donald Trump,"And I’ll tell you something, some people say maybe the most important by the end of the first term I’ll have approximately 300 Federal judges and Court of Appeals judges, 300 and hopefully three great Supreme Court judges, justices that is a record the likes of which very few people and one of the reasons I’ll have so many judges because President Obama and him left me 128 judges to fill.",,
Donald Trump,"When you leave office, you don’t leave any judges.",,
Donald Trump,"That’s like, you just don’t do that.",,
Donald Trump,"They left 128 openings and if I were a member of his party, because they have a little different philosophy, I’d say, if you left us 128 openings you can’t be a good president.",,
Donald Trump,"You can’t be a good vice president but I want to thank you because it gives us almost, it’ll probably be above that number.",,
Donald Trump,"By the end of this term, 300 judges.",,
Donald Trump,It’s a record.,,
Chris Wallace,Looking at both of your records.,,
Chris Wallace,"Why should voters elect you President as opposed to president Trump, you have two minutes uninterrupted.",,
Joe Biden,"Under this president, we become weaker, sicker, poor, more divided and more violent.",,
Joe Biden,"When I was vice president, we inherited a recession.",,
Joe Biden,I was asked to fix it.,,
Joe Biden,I did.,,
Joe Biden,We left him a booming economy and he caused the recession.,,
Joe Biden,"With regard to being weaker, the fact is that I’ve gone head to head with Putin and made it clear to him we’re not going to take any of his stuff.",,
Joe Biden,He’s Putin’s puppy.,,
Joe Biden,He still refuses to even say anything to Putin about the bounty on the heads of American soldiers.,,
Donald Trump,You son got three and a half million dollars.,,
Joe Biden,"By the way, my son…",,
Chris Wallace,Wait a minute.,,
Chris Wallace,"Mr. President, your campaign agreed to both sides would get two minute answers, uninterrupted.",,
Chris Wallace,"Well, you’re a side agreed to it and why don’t you observe what your campaign agreed to as a ground rule.",,
Chris Wallace,"Okay, sir?",,
Joe Biden,He never keeps his word.,,
Chris Wallace,"No, that was a rhetorical question.",,
Joe Biden,Can you get back 30 seconds?,,
Chris Wallace,Yes.,,
Chris Wallace,"You may have, go ahead.",,
Joe Biden,"So thirdly, we’re poor.",,
Joe Biden,The billionaires have gotten much more wealthy by a tune of over $3- $400 billion more just since COVID.,,
Joe Biden,"You in the home, you got less you’re in more trouble than you were before.",,
Joe Biden,In terms of being more violent.,,
Joe Biden,When we were in office there were 15% less violence in America than there is today.,,
Joe Biden,He’s President United States.,,
Joe Biden,It’s on his watch.,,
Joe Biden,"And with regard to more divided the nation, it can’t stay divided.",,
Joe Biden,We can’t be this way.,,
Joe Biden,"And speaking of my son, the way you talk about the military, the way you talk about them being losers and being and just being suckers.",,
Joe Biden,My son was in Iraq.,,
Joe Biden,He spent a year there.,,
Joe Biden,He got the Brown Star.,,
Joe Biden,He got the Conspicuous Service Medal.,,
Joe Biden,He was not a loser.,,
Joe Biden,He was a Patriot and the people left behind there were heroes.,,
Donald Trump,Really?,,
Joe Biden,And I resent-,,
Donald Trump,"Are you talking Hunter, are you talking about Hunter.",,
Joe Biden,"I’m talking about my son, Beau Biden, you’re talking about Hunter?",,
Donald Trump,I don’t know Beau.,,
Donald Trump,I know Hunter.,,
Donald Trump,Hunter got thrown out of the military.,,
Donald Trump,He was thrown out dishonorably discharged.,,
Joe Biden,That’s not true he was not dishonorably discharged.,,
Donald Trump,For cocaine use.,,
Donald Trump,And he didn’t have a job until you became vice president.,,
Joe Biden,None of that is true.,,
Donald Trump,"Once you became vice president he made a fortune in Ukraine, in China, in Moscow and various other places.",,
Joe Biden,That is not true.,,
Donald Trump,He made a fortune and he didn’t have a job.,,
Joe Biden,My son like a lot of people at home had a drug problem.,,
Joe Biden,He’s overtaking it.,,
Joe Biden,He’s fixed it.,,
Joe Biden,He’s worked on it.,,
Joe Biden,"And I’m proud of him, I’m proud of my son.",,
Donald Trump,But why was he given tens of millions of dollars?,,
Joe Biden,He wasn’t given tens of millions of dollars.,,
Joe Biden,[crosstalk 00:48:23] It was all discredited.,,
Chris Wallace,We’ve already been through this.,,
Chris Wallace,I think the American people would rather hear about more substantial subjects.,,
Chris Wallace,"Well, as the moderator, sir, I’m going to make a judgment call here.",,
Donald Trump,I know but when somebody gets three and a half million dollars from the Mayor of Moscow.,,
Joe Biden,That is not true.,,
Joe Biden,That report is totally discredited.,,
Donald Trump,Why did he get it?,,
Joe Biden,Mitt Romney on that committee said it wasn’t worth taxpayer’s money.,,
Joe Biden,That report was written for political reason.,,
Chris Wallace,I’d like to talk about climate change.,,
Joe Biden,So would I.,,
Chris Wallace,Okay.,,
Chris Wallace,The forest fires in the West are raging now.,,
Chris Wallace,They have burned millions of acres.,,
Chris Wallace,They have displaced hundreds of thousands of people.,,
Chris Wallace,When state officials there blamed the fires on climate change.,,
Chris Wallace,"Mr. President, you said, I don’t think the science knows.",,
Chris Wallace,"Over your four years, you have pulled the US out of the Paris Climate Accord.",,
Chris Wallace,"You have rolled back a number of Obama Environmental records, what do you believe about the science of climate change and what will you do in the next four years to confront it?",,
Donald Trump,I want crystal clean water and air.,,
Donald Trump,I want beautiful clean air.,,
Donald Trump,"We have now the lowest carbon… If you look at our numbers right now, we are doing phenomenally.",,
Donald Trump,But I haven’t destroyed our businesses.,,
Donald Trump,Our businesses aren’t put out of commission.,,
Donald Trump,"If you look at the Paris Accord, it was a disaster from our standpoint.",,
Donald Trump,And people are actually very happy about what’s going on because our businesses are doing well.,,
Donald Trump,"As far as the fires are concerned, you need forest management.",,
Donald Trump,"In addition to everything else, the forest floors are loaded up with trees, dead trees that are years old and they’re like tinder and leaves and everything else.",,
Donald Trump,You drop a cigarette in there the whole forest burns down.,,
Donald Trump,You’ve got to have forest management.,,
Chris Wallace,"What do you believe about the science of climate change, sir?",,
Donald Trump,I believe that we have to do everything we can to have immaculate air immaculate water and do whatever else we can that’s good.,,
Donald Trump,"We’re planting a billion trees, the Billion Tree Project and it’s very exciting for a lot of people.",,
Chris Wallace,"You believe that human pollution, gas, greenhouse gas emissions contributes to the global warming of this planet.",,
Donald Trump,"I think a lot of things do, but I think to an extent, yes.",,
Donald Trump,"I think to an extent, yes, but I also think we have to do better management of our forest.",,
Donald Trump,Every year I get the call.,,
Donald Trump,"California’s burning, California’s burning.",,
Donald Trump,"If that was cleaned, if that were, if you had forest management, good forest management, you wouldn’t be getting those calls.",,
Donald Trump,"In Europe, they live they’re forest cities.",,
Donald Trump,They call forest cities.,,
Donald Trump,They maintain their forest.,,
Donald Trump,They manage their forest.,,
Donald Trump,"I was with the head of a major country, it’s a forest city.",,
Donald Trump,"He said, “Sir, we have trees that are far more, they ignite much easier than California.",,
Donald Trump,There shouldn’t be that problem.” I spoke with the Governor about it.,,
Donald Trump,I’m getting along very well with the governor.,,
Donald Trump,"But I said, “At some point you can’t every year have hundreds of thousands of acres of land just burned to the ground.” That’s burning down because of a lack of management.",,
Chris Wallace,"But sir if you believe in the science of climate change, why have you rolled back the Obama Clean Power Plan which limited carbon emissions and power plants?",,
Chris Wallace,Why have you relaxed…?,,
Donald Trump,Because it was driving energy prices through the sky.,,
Joe Biden,Why have you relaxed fuel economy standards that are going to create more pollution from cars and trucks?,,
Donald Trump,"Well, not really because what’s happening is the car is much less expensive and it’s a much safer car and you talk it about a tiny difference.",,
Donald Trump,And then what would happen because of the cost of the car you would have at least double and triple the number of cars purchased.,,
Donald Trump,"We have the old slugs out there that are 10, 12 years old.",,
Donald Trump,"If you did that, the car would be safer.",,
Donald Trump,"It would be much cheaper by $3,500.",,
Chris Wallace,But in the case of California they have simply ignored that.,,
Donald Trump,"No, but you would take a lot of cars off the market because people would be able to afford a car.",,
Donald Trump,"Now, by the way, we’re going to see how that turns out.",,
Donald Trump,"But a lot of people agree with me, many people.",,
Donald Trump,The car has gotten so expensive because they have computers all over the place for an extra little bit of gasoline.,,
Donald Trump,And I’m okay with electric cars too.,,
Donald Trump,I think I’m all for electric cars.,,
Donald Trump,I’ve given big incentives for electric cars but what they’ve done in California is just crazy.,,
Chris Wallace,"All right, Vice president Biden.",,
Chris Wallace,I’d like you to respond to the president’s climate change record but I also want to ask you about a concern.,,
Chris Wallace,You propose $2 trillion in green jobs.,,
Chris Wallace,"You talk about new limits, not abolishing, but new limits on fracking.",,
Chris Wallace,Ending the use of fossil fuels to generate electricity by 2035 and zero none admission of greenhouse gases by 2050.,,
Chris Wallace,The president says a lot of these things would tank the economy and cost millions of jobs.,,
Joe Biden,"He’s absolutely wrong, number one.",,
Joe Biden,"Number two, if in fact, during our administration in the recovery act, I was in charge able to bring down the cost of renewable energy to cheaper than are as cheap as coal and gas and oil.",,
Joe Biden,Nobody’s going to build another coal fired plant in America.,,
Joe Biden,No one’s going to build another oil fire plant in America.,,
Joe Biden,They’re going to move to renewable energy.,,
Joe Biden,"Number one, number two, we’re going to make sure that we are able to take the federal fleet and turn it into a fleet that’s run on their electric vehicles.",,
Joe Biden,"Making sure that we can do that, we’re going to put 500,000 charging stations in all of the highways that we’re going to be building in the future.",,
Joe Biden,We’re going to build a economy that in fact is going to provide for the ability of us to take 4 million buildings and make sure that they in fact are weatherized in a way that in fact will they’ll emit significantly less gas and oil because the heat will not be going out.,,
Joe Biden,There’s so many things that we can do…,,
Joe Biden,Gas and oil because the heat will not be going out.,,
Joe Biden,There’s so many things that we can do now to create thousands and thousands of jobs.,,
Joe Biden,"We can get to net zero, in terms of energy production, by 2035.",,
Joe Biden,"Not only not costing people jobs, creating jobs, creating millions of good-paying jobs.",,
Joe Biden,"Not 15 bucks an hour, but prevailing wage, by having a new infrastructure that in fact, is green.",,
Joe Biden,"And the first thing I will do, I will rejoin the Paris Accord.",,
Joe Biden,"I will join the Paris Accord because with us out of it, look what’s happening.",,
Joe Biden,It’s all falling apart.,,
Joe Biden,And talk about someone who has no relationship with foreign policy.,,
Joe Biden,"The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down, are being ripped down.",,
Joe Biden,More carbon is absorbed in that rainforest than every bit of carbon that’s emitted in the United States.,,
Joe Biden,"Instead of doing something about that, I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, “Here’s $20 billion.",,
Joe Biden,Stop tearing down the forest.,,
Joe Biden,"And If you don’t, then you’re going to have significant economic consequences.”",,
Chris Wallace,"What about the argument that President Trump basically says, that you have to balance environmental interests and economic interests?",,
Chris Wallace,And he’s drawn his line.,,
Joe Biden,"Well, he hasn’t drawn a line.",,
Joe Biden,He wants to make sure that methane’s not a problem.,,
Joe Biden,You can now emit more methane without it being a problem.,,
Joe Biden,Methane.,,
Joe Biden,This is a guy who says that you don’t have to have mileage standards for automobiles that exist now.,,
Joe Biden,"This is the guy who says that, the fact that-",,
Donald Trump,Not true.,,
Donald Trump,Not true-,,
Joe Biden,It’s all true.,,
Joe Biden,And here’s the deal-,,
Donald Trump,He’s talking about the Green New Deal.,,
Donald Trump,"And it’s not 2 billion [crosstalk 00:55:45] or 20 billion, as you said [crosstalk 00:55:46].",,
Donald Trump,It’s $100 trillion.,,
Joe Biden,I’m talking about the Biden plan [crosstalk 00:55:51]-,,
Chris Wallace,"Let him go for a minute, and then you can go.",,
Donald Trump,And rebuild the building.,,
Joe Biden,No.,,
Donald Trump,It’s the dumbest-,,
Joe Biden,That is not-,,
Donald Trump,… most ridiculous [crosstalk 00:55:56] where two car systems are out-,,
Joe Biden,Not true-,,
Donald Trump,… where they want to take out the cows too.,,
Joe Biden,Not true.,,
Donald Trump,"That’s not true either, right?",,
Joe Biden,Not true.,,
Donald Trump,This is a 100 trillion-,,
Joe Biden,Simply… Look-,,
Donald Trump,That’s more money than our country could make in 100 years [crosstalk 00:02:10]-,,
Joe Biden,That is simply not the case-,,
Chris Wallace,All right.,,
Chris Wallace,Let me [crosstalk 00:02:12].,,
Chris Wallace,"Wait a minute, sir.",,
Chris Wallace,"I actually have studied your plan, and it includes upgrading 4 million buildings, weatherizing 2 million homes over four years, building one and a half million energy efficient homes.",,
Chris Wallace,"So the question becomes, the president is saying, I think some people who support the president would say, that sounds like it’s going to cost a lot of money and hurt the economy.",,
Joe Biden,"What it’s going to do, it’s going to create thousands and millions of jobs.",,
Joe Biden,Good paying jobs [crosstalk 00:02:41].,,
Chris Wallace,"Let him finish, sir.",,
Joe Biden,He doesn’t know how to do that-,,
Donald Trump,100 million dollars.,,
Joe Biden,"The fact is, it’s going to create millions of good paying jobs, and these tax incentives for people to weatherize, which he wants to get rid of.",,
Joe Biden,It’s going to make the economy much safer.,,
Joe Biden,"Look how much we’re paying now to deal with the hurricanes, deal with… By the way, he has an answer for hurricanes.",,
Joe Biden,"He said, maybe we should drop a nuclear weapon on them, and they may-",,
Donald Trump,I never said that at all-,,
Joe Biden,"Yeah, he did say that-",,
Donald Trump,They made it up.,,
Joe Biden,And here’s the deal-,,
Donald Trump,You make up a lot-,,
Joe Biden,"… we’re going to be in a position where we can create hard, hard, good jobs by making sure the environment is clean, and we all are in better shape.",,
Joe Biden,"We spend billions of dollars now, billions of dollars, on floods, hurricanes, rising seas.",,
Joe Biden,We’re in real trouble.,,
Joe Biden,Look what’s happened just in the Midwest with these storms that come through and wipe out entire sections and counties in Iowa.,,
Joe Biden,They didn’t happen before.,,
Joe Biden,They’re because of global warming.,,
Joe Biden,We make up 15% of the world’s problem.,,
Joe Biden,"But the rest of the world, we’ve got to get them to come along.",,
Joe Biden,That’s why we have to get back into the Paris Accord.,,
Chris Wallace,"All right, gentlemen-",,
Donald Trump,"Wait a minute, Chris.",,
Donald Trump,So why didn’t he do it for 47 years?,,
Donald Trump,You were vice president-,,
Joe Biden,For 47-,,
Donald Trump,So why didn’t you get the world… China sends up real dirt into the air.,,
Donald Trump,Russia does.,,
Donald Trump,India does.,,
Donald Trump,They all do.,,
Donald Trump,We’re supposed to be good.,,
Donald Trump,"And by the way, he made a couple of statements.",,
Donald Trump,The Green New Deal is a hundred trillion dollars.,,
Joe Biden,That is not my plan [crosstalk 00:58:10].,,
Joe Biden,The Green New Deal [crosstalk 00:58:14] is not my plan.,,
Joe Biden,[crosstalk 00:58:15]-,,
Chris Wallace,Gentlemen-,,
Donald Trump,He made a statement about the military.,,
Donald Trump,He said I said something about the military.,,
Donald Trump,"He and his friends made it up, and then they went with it.",,
Donald Trump,I never said it.,,
Chris Wallace,Okay.,,
Chris Wallace,[crosstalk 00:58:24] Mr. Vice President-,,
Donald Trump,He called the military stupid bastards.,,
Joe Biden,I did not say that-,,
Donald Trump,He said it on tape.,,
Donald Trump,[crosstalk 00:58:32]-,,
Chris Wallace,"Please, sir.",,
Chris Wallace,[crosstalk 00:58:33] Stop.,,
Donald Trump,I would never say that [crosstalk 00:58:35]-,,
Joe Biden,Play it.,,
Joe Biden,Play it-,,
Chris Wallace,Stop.,,
Chris Wallace,Go ahead-,,
Donald Trump,You’re on tape-,,
Chris Wallace,Mr. Vice President answered his final question.,,
Joe Biden,"The final question is, I can’t remember which of all his rantings [crosstalk 00:04:44].",,
Chris Wallace,"I’m having a little trouble myself, but…",,
Joe Biden,Yeah.,,
Chris Wallace,And about the economy and about this question of what it’s going to cost.,,
Joe Biden,The economy-,,
Chris Wallace,The Green New Deal and the idea of what your environmental changes will do-,,
Joe Biden,The Green New Deal will pay for itself as we move forward.,,
Joe Biden,"We’re not going to build plants that, in fact, are great polluting plants-",,
Chris Wallace,"So, do you support the Green New Deal?",,
Joe Biden,Pardon me?,,
Chris Wallace,Do you support the-,,
Joe Biden,"No, I don’t support the Green New Deal.",,
Donald Trump,"Oh, you don’t?",,
Donald Trump,"Oh, well, that’s a big statement.",,
Joe Biden,I support [crosstalk 00:05:13]-,,
Donald Trump,You just lost the radical left.,,
Joe Biden,I support [crosstalk 00:59:17] the Biden plan that I put forward.,,
Chris Wallace,Okay.,,
Joe Biden,"The Biden plan, which is different than what he calls the radical Green New Deal.",,
Chris Wallace,"All right, gentlemen, final segment, election integrity.",,
Chris Wallace,"As we meet tonight, millions of Americans are receiving mail-in ballots or going to vote early.",,
Chris Wallace,"How confident should we be that this will be a fair election, and what are you prepared to do over the next five plus weeks?",,
Chris Wallace,"Because it will not only be to election day, but also counting some mail-in ballots after election day.",,
Chris Wallace,What are you prepared to do to reassure the American people that the next president will be the legitimate winner of this election.,,
Chris Wallace,"In this final segment, Mr. Vice President, you go first.",,
Joe Biden,Prepare to let people vote.,,
Joe Biden,"They should go to iwillvote.com, decide how they’re going to vote, when they’re going to vote, and what means by which they’re going to vote.",,
Joe Biden,"His own Homeland Security director, and as well as the FBI director, says that there is no evidence at all that mail-in ballots are a source of being manipulated and cheating.",,
Joe Biden,They said that.,,
Joe Biden,"The fact is that there are going to be millions of people because of COVID that are going to be voting by mail-in ballots like he does, by the way.",,
Joe Biden,"He sits behind the Resolute Desk and sends his ballot to Florida, number one.",,
Joe Biden,"Number two, we’re going to make sure that those people who want to vote in person are able to vote because there are enough poll watchers are there to make sure they can socially distance.",,
Joe Biden,"The polls are open on time, and the polls stay open until the votes are counted.",,
Joe Biden,And this is all about trying to dissuade people from voting because he’s trying to scare people into thinking that it’s not going to be legitimate.,,
Joe Biden,Show up and vote.,,
Joe Biden,You will determine the outcome of this election.,,
Joe Biden,"Vote, vote, vote.",,
Joe Biden,"If you’re able to vote early in your state, vote early.",,
Joe Biden,"If you’re able to vote in person, vote in person.",,
Joe Biden,"Vote whatever way is the best way for you, because you will… He cannot stop you from being able to determine the outcome of this election.",,
Joe Biden,"And in terms of whether or not… When the votes are counted and they’re all counted, that will be accepted.",,
Joe Biden,"If I win, that will be accepted.",,
Joe Biden,"If I lose, that’ll be accepted.",,
Joe Biden,"But by the way, if in fact he says, he’s not sure what he’s going to accept.",,
Joe Biden,"Well, let me tell you something, it doesn’t matter, because if we get the votes, it’s going to be all over.",,
Joe Biden,He’s going to go.,,
Joe Biden,He can’t stay in power.,,
Joe Biden,It won’t happen.,,
Joe Biden,"It won’t happen, so vote.",,
Joe Biden,"Just make sure you understand, you have it in your control to determine what this country is going to look like the next four years.",,
Joe Biden,"Is it going to change, or are you going to get four more years of these lies?",,
Chris Wallace,"Mr. President, two minutes.",,
Donald Trump,"So when I listen to Joe talking about a transition, there has been no transition from when I won.",,
Donald Trump,I won that election.,,
Donald Trump,"And if you look at crooked Hillary Clinton, if you look at all of the different people, there was no transition, because they came after me trying to do a coup.",,
Donald Trump,They came after me spying on my campaign.,,
Donald Trump,"They started from the day I won, and even before I won.",,
Donald Trump,"From the day I came down the escalator with our first lady, they were a disaster.",,
Donald Trump,"They were a disgrace to our country, and we’ve caught them.",,
Donald Trump,We’ve caught them all.,,
Donald Trump,We’ve got it all on tape.,,
Donald Trump,We’ve caught them all.,,
Donald Trump,"And by the way, you gave the idea for the Logan Act against General Flynn.",,
Donald Trump,"You better take a look at that, because we caught you in a sense, and President Obama was sitting in the office.",,
Donald Trump,He knew about it too.,,
Donald Trump,So don’t tell me about a free transition.,,
Donald Trump,"As far as the ballots are concerned, it’s a disaster.",,
Donald Trump,"A solicited ballot, okay, solicited, is okay.",,
Donald Trump,You’re soliciting.,,
Donald Trump,You’re asking.,,
Donald Trump,They send it back.,,
Donald Trump,You send it back.,,
Donald Trump,I did that.,,
Donald Trump,If you have an unsolicited… They’re sending millions of ballots all over the country.,,
Donald Trump,There’s fraud.,,
Donald Trump,They found them in creeks.,,
Donald Trump,"They found some, just happened to have the name Trump just the other day in a wastepaper basket.",,
Donald Trump,They’re being sent all over the place.,,
Donald Trump,They sent two in a Democrat area.,,
Donald Trump,They sent out a thousand ballots.,,
Donald Trump,Everybody got two ballots.,,
Donald Trump,This is going to be a fraud like you’ve never seen.,,
Donald Trump,"The other thing, it’s nice.",,
Donald Trump,"On November 3rd, you’re watching, and you see who won the election.",,
Donald Trump,And I think we’re going to do well because people are really happy with the job we’ve done.,,
Donald Trump,But you know what?,,
Donald Trump,We won’t know.,,
Donald Trump,We might not know for months because these ballots are going to be all over.,,
Donald Trump,Take a look at what happened in Manhattan.,,
Donald Trump,Take a look at what happened in New Jersey.,,
Donald Trump,Take a look at what happened in Virginia and other places.,,
Donald Trump,"They’re not losing 2%, 1%, which by the way is too much.",,
Donald Trump,An election could be won or lost with that.,,
Donald Trump,They’re losing 30 and 40%.,,
Donald Trump,"It’s a fraud, and it’s a shame.",,
Donald Trump,"And can you imagine where they say, “You have to have your ballot in by November 10th.” November 10th.",,
Donald Trump,"That’s seven days after the election, in theory, should have been announced.",,
Donald Trump,We have major states [crosstalk 01:03:58] with that-,,
Chris Wallace,Sir.,,
Donald Trump,… all run by Democrats-,,
Chris Wallace,Two minutes is two minutes.,,
Donald Trump,All run by Democrats.,,
Chris Wallace,President Trump-,,
Donald Trump,It’s a rigged election.,,
Chris Wallace,You’re going to be able to continue.,,
Chris Wallace,You have been charging for months that mail-in balloting is going to be a disaster.,,
Chris Wallace,"You say it’s rigged [crosstalk 00:01:04:11], that it’s going to lead to fraud.",,
Chris Wallace,"But in 2018, in the last midterm election, 31 million people voted mail-in voting.",,
Chris Wallace,"That was more than a quarter of all the voters that year, cast their ballots by mail.",,
Chris Wallace,"Now that millions of mail-in ballots have gone out, what are you going to do about it?",,
Chris Wallace,"And are you counting on the Supreme Court, including a Justice Barrett, to settle any dispute?",,
Donald Trump,Yeah.,,
Donald Trump,"I think I’m counting on them to look at the ballots, definitely.",,
Donald Trump,"I hope we don’t need them, in terms of the election itself.",,
Donald Trump,"But for the ballots, I think so, because what’s happening is incredible.",,
Donald Trump,I read today where at least 1% of the ballots for 2016 were invalidated.,,
Donald Trump,They take them.,,
Donald Trump,We don’t like them.,,
Donald Trump,We don’t like them.,,
Donald Trump,They throw them out-,,
Chris Wallace,But what are you going to do about it-,,
Donald Trump,… left and right.,,
Chris Wallace,There are millions of ballots going out right now.,,
Chris Wallace,What are you going to do-,,
Donald Trump,What you do is you go and vote.,,
Donald Trump,"You do a solicited ballot, and that’s okay-",,
Chris Wallace,No.,,
Chris Wallace,No.,,
Chris Wallace,I know your complaint [crosstalk 01:05:05].,,
Chris Wallace,I’m asking you about the fact that millions of people have received-,,
Donald Trump,You go and vote.,,
Donald Trump,You go and vote-,,
Chris Wallace,No.,,
Chris Wallace,"But what I’m saying is [crosstalk 01:05:11], what are you going to do about the fact that millions of people-",,
Donald Trump,"You either do, Chris, a solicited ballot, where you’re sending it in, they’re sending it back and you’re sending.",,
Donald Trump,They have mailmen with lots of it.,,
Donald Trump,Did you see what’s going on?,,
Donald Trump,"Take a look at West Virginia, mailman selling the ballots.",,
Donald Trump,They’re being sold.,,
Donald Trump,They’re being dumped in rivers.,,
Donald Trump,This is a horrible thing for our country.,,
Joe Biden,There is no [crosstalk 01:05:32]… There is no evidence of that-,,
Donald Trump,This is not going to end well.,,
Joe Biden,There is no evidence of that-,,
Donald Trump,This is not going to end well-,,
Chris Wallace,Okay.,,
Chris Wallace,"Vice President Biden, in fact, go ahead, sir-",,
Joe Biden,Five states have had mail-in ballots for the last decade or more.,,
Joe Biden,"Five, including two Republican states.",,
Joe Biden,And you don’t have to solicit the ballot.,,
Joe Biden,It’s sent to you.,,
Joe Biden,It’s sent to your home.,,
Joe Biden,What they’re saying is that it has to be a postmark by election day.,,
Joe Biden,"If it doesn’t get in until the seventh, eighth, ninth, it still should be counted.",,
Joe Biden,He’s just afraid of counting the votes-,,
Donald Trump,You’re wrong.,,
Donald Trump,You’re wrong [crosstalk 01:06:04].,,
Donald Trump,I love counting the votes [crosstalk 01:06:05]-,,
Chris Wallace,I want to continue with you on this [crosstalk 01:06:06] Vice President Biden-,,
Donald Trump,"Chris, he’s so wrong when he makes a statement like that-",,
Chris Wallace,No.,,
Chris Wallace,Excuse me.,,
Chris Wallace,"Vice President Biden, the biggest problem, in fact, over the years with mail-in voting has not been fraud, historically.",,
Chris Wallace,"It has been that sizable numbers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of ballots are thrown out because they have not been properly filled out, or there is some other irregularity, or they missed [crosstalk 01:06:28] the deadline.",,
Chris Wallace,"So the question I have is, are you concerned that the Supreme Court with a Justice Barrett will settle any dispute?",,
Joe Biden,"I am concerned that any court would settle this, because here’s the deal.",,
Joe Biden,"When you get a ballot and you fill it out, you’re supposed to have an affidavit.",,
Joe Biden,"If you didn’t know, you have someone say that, this is me.",,
Joe Biden,"You should be able to, if in fact you can verify that’s you before the ballot is thrown out, that’s sufficient to be able to count the ballot because someone made a mistake and not dotting the correct I.",,
Joe Biden,"Who they voted for, testify, say who they voted for, say it’s you.",,
Joe Biden,That is totally legitimate.,,
Chris Wallace,All right.,,
Donald Trump,Excuse me [crosstalk 01:07:11]-,,
Chris Wallace,No.,,
Chris Wallace,No.,,
Chris Wallace,No.,,
Chris Wallace,I have a final [crosstalk 00:13:12].,,
Chris Wallace,"Gentlemen, I have a final question [crosstalk 01:07:14]-",,
Donald Trump,You know it can’t be done.,,
Donald Trump,"You know it can’t, and already, there’s been fraud [crosstalk 01:07:19]-",,
Joe Biden,Mail service delivers [crosstalk 01:07:21] 185 million pieces of mail a day [crosstalk 01:07:24]-,,
Chris Wallace,We can keep talking.,,
Chris Wallace,"In eight states, [crosstalk 01:07:27] election workers are prohibited, currently by law, eight states, from even beginning to process ballots, even take them out of the envelopes and flatten them until election day.",,
Chris Wallace,"That means that it’s likely, because there’s going to be a huge increase in mail-in balloting, that we are not going to know on election night who the winner is, that it could be days.",,
Chris Wallace,It could be weeks-,,
Donald Trump,Could be months-,,
Chris Wallace,… until we find out who the new president is.,,
Chris Wallace,"First for you, sir.",,
Chris Wallace,"Finally, for the vice president, and I hope neither of you will interrupt the other.",,
Chris Wallace,"Will you urge your supporters to stay calm during this extended period, not to engage in any civil unrest?",,
Chris Wallace,And will you pledge tonight that you will not declare victory until the election has been independently certified?,,
Chris Wallace,"President Trump, you go first-",,
Donald Trump,"I’m urging my supporters to go in to the polls and watch very carefully, because that’s what has to happen.",,
Donald Trump,I am urging them to do it.,,
Donald Trump,"As you know, today there was a big problem.",,
Donald Trump,"In Philadelphia, they went in to watch.",,
Donald Trump,"They’re called poll watchers, a very safe, very nice thing.",,
Donald Trump,They were thrown out.,,
Donald Trump,They weren’t allowed to watch.,,
Donald Trump,You know why?,,
Donald Trump,Because bad things happen in Philadelphia.,,
Donald Trump,Bad things.,,
Donald Trump,And I am urging my people.,,
Donald Trump,I hope it’s going to be a fair election.,,
Donald Trump,If it’s a fair election-,,
Chris Wallace,You’re urging them what?,,
Donald Trump,… I am 100% on board.,,
Donald Trump,"But if I see tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can’t go along with that.",,
Donald Trump,And I’ll tell you why-,,
Chris Wallace,"What does that mean, not go along-",,
Donald Trump,… from a common sense-,,
Chris Wallace,Does that mean you’re going to tell your people-,,
Donald Trump,I’ll tell you what it means-,,
Chris Wallace,… to take to the streets?,,
Donald Trump,It means you have a fraudulent election.,,
Donald Trump,You’re sending out 80 million ballots-,,
Chris Wallace,And what would you do about that?,,
Donald Trump,"They’re not equipped… These people aren’t equipped to handle it, number one.",,
Donald Trump,"Number two, they cheat.",,
Donald Trump,They cheat.,,
Donald Trump,"Hey, they found ballots in a wastepaper basket three days ago, and they all had the name military ballots.",,
Donald Trump,There were military.,,
Donald Trump,They all had the name Trump on them.,,
Chris Wallace,Vice President Biden-,,
Donald Trump,You think that’s good?,,
Chris Wallace,"Vice President Biden, final question for you.",,
Chris Wallace,Will you urge your supporters to stay calm while the vote is counted?,,
Chris Wallace,And will you pledge not to declare victory until the election is independently certified?,,
Joe Biden,Yes.,,
Joe Biden,And here’s the deal.,,
Joe Biden,"We count the ballots, as you pointed out.",,
Joe Biden,Some of these ballots in some states can’t even be opened until election day.,,
Joe Biden,"And if there’s thousands of ballots, it’s going to take time to do it.",,
Joe Biden,"And by the way, our military… They’ve been voting by ballots since the end of the Civil War, in effect.",,
Joe Biden,And that’s what’s going to happen.,,
Joe Biden,"Why is it, for them, somehow not fraudulent.",,
Joe Biden,It’s the same process.,,
Joe Biden,It’s honest.,,
Joe Biden,"No one has established at all that there is fraud related to mail-in ballots, that somehow it’s a fraudulent process.",,
Donald Trump,It’s already been established.,,
Donald Trump,Take a look at Carolyn Maloney’s race-,,
Chris Wallace,I asked you.,,
Chris Wallace,You had an opportunity to respond [crosstalk 01:10:13].,,
Chris Wallace,Go ahead [crosstalk 01:10:14].,,
Chris Wallace,"Vice President Biden, go ahead.",,
Joe Biden,He has no idea what he’s talking about.,,
Joe Biden,Here’s the deal.,,
Joe Biden,"The fact is, I will accept it, and he will too.",,
Joe Biden,You know why?,,
Joe Biden,"Because once the winner is declared after all the ballots are counted, all the votes are counted, that’ll be the end of it.",,
Joe Biden,That’ll be the end of it.,,
Joe Biden,"And if it’s me, in fact, fine.",,
Joe Biden,"If it’s not me, I’ll support the outcome.",,
Joe Biden,"And I’ll be a president, not just for the Democrats.",,
Joe Biden,I’ll be a president for Democrats and Republicans.,,
Joe Biden,And this guy-,,
Donald Trump,I want to see an honest ballot cut-,,
Chris Wallace,"Gentlemen, just say that’s the end of it [crosstalk 01:10:45].",,
Chris Wallace,This is the end of this debate-,,
Donald Trump,I want to see an honest ballot count.,,
Chris Wallace,We’re going to leave it there-,,
Donald Trump,And I think he does too-,,
Chris Wallace,… to be continued in more debates as we go on.,,
Chris Wallace,"President Trump, Vice President Biden, it’s been an interesting hour and a half.",,
Chris Wallace,I want to thank you both for participating in the first of three debates that you have agreed to engage in.,,
Chris Wallace,We want to thank Case Western Reserve University and the Cleveland Clinic for hosting this event.,,
Chris Wallace,"The next debate, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, will be one week from tomorrow, October 7th, at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.",,
Chris Wallace,"The two vice presidential nominees, Vice President Mike Pence and Senator Kamala Harris will debate at 9:00 PM Eastern that night.",,
Chris Wallace,We hope you watch.,,
Chris Wallace,"Until then, thank you, and good night.",,
Chris Wallace,Thank you.,,
