Savannah Guthrie,It’s nothing but noise.,,
Savannah Guthrie,What?,,
Savannah Guthrie,Okay.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"All right, ladies and gentlemen, not withstanding a little, few technical difficulties, we’re thrilled to have you tonight.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"And we are very honored by the presence of our president, Donald Trump, who is going to walk in right now.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"We are about 30 seconds from air, so it’ll be just in time.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Mr. President.,,
Voice Over,This is an NBC news special presentation of Today with Savannah Guthrie.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Tonight, Donald Trump in the arena.",,
Savannah Guthrie,His first prime time network appearance since falling ill with Coronavirus.,,
Donald Trump,"I’m feeling great, I don’t know about you.",,
Donald Trump,How is everyone feeling?,,
Savannah Guthrie,"With tonight’s debate canceled, the President faces our questions live and hears from voters about their concerns in the battleground state of Florida.",,
Donald Trump,"It’s great to be back in my home state, Florida, to make my official return to the campaign trail.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"With just 19 days to go, the President makes his case.",,
Donald Trump,My goal is to fight for you and fight for your family.,,
Voice Over,"From NBC News, Decision 2020, President Trump Town Hall.",,
Voice Over,"Live from the Perez Art Museum in Miami, here’s Savannah Guthrie.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Hi everybody, and good evening.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"It’s good to have you with us, and welcome to Miami and our town hall with President Donald Trump.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"And we want to say right off the top, this is not how things were supposed to go tonight.",,
Savannah Guthrie,This was supposed to be a town hall debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"But after the President contracted COVID, the debate commission announced it would have to be a virtual debate because of health concerns.",,
Savannah Guthrie,The President then said he would not participate in a virtual debate.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"At that point, Joe Biden scheduled a town hall tonight in Pennsylvania on another network, and now the President is doing the same, his own town hall with the same venue format and time as NBC’s town hall with Joe Biden last week.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"So the two candidates go head to head tonight, though, not face to face, each in a key battleground state.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"And tonight, the President will be taking questions from voters here in Miami, who we should mention are socially distanced and they’re wearing masks.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"And I should say, this audience looks a bit like America, it’s divided.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Some here voted for the president in 2016 and plan to again, some support Joe Biden, and some say they are truly undecided.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"We’re going to get a mix of questions on a range of topics, and we’re going to get to those questions in a moment.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"But first with all of that ado, welcome, Mr. President, and thank you for being here.",,
Donald Trump,"That was very well stated, I have to say.",,
Donald Trump,Good job.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Thank you.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"We’re glad you’re here, we’re glad you’re well.",,
Savannah Guthrie,We send our best to the First Lady and to Barron.,,
Donald Trump,"Thank you, thank you.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Do you have any remaining symptoms from COVID?,,
Donald Trump,"Nothing whatsoever, I’m great, I feel good.",,
Donald Trump,"I was in North Carolina today and did a big rally with tremendous turnout, and I just feel really good.",,
Donald Trump,"Florida, Pennsylvania, were- They said, “Let’s go to the hospital.” I said, “That’s okay.",,
Donald Trump,"I’m going to respond to what you say.” And we went over to Walter Reed, where you have tremendous professionals.",,
Donald Trump,They gave me Regeneron and Remdeceiver both.,,
Donald Trump,"And all I know is I felt good the following day, I felt really good.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Did the doctors ever tell you that they saw pneumonia on your lung scans?,,
Donald Trump,"No, but they said the lungs are a little bit different, a little bit perhaps infected, and-",,
Savannah Guthrie,Infected with?,,
Donald Trump,I don’t know.,,
Donald Trump,"I mean, I didn’t do too much asking.",,
Donald Trump,I really felt good.,,
Donald Trump,I didn’t have much of a problem with the lungs.,,
Donald Trump,I did have a little bit of a temperature.,,
Donald Trump,"Obviously, I felt there was something missing, and then I tested, I tested positive.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Well, let’s talk about testing because there’s a little bit of a, I guess, confusion about this.",,
Savannah Guthrie,And I think we can clear it up.,,
Donald Trump,"Yeah, and there shouldn’t be.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Your first positive test was Thursday, October 1st, okay?",,
Savannah Guthrie,When was your last negative test?,,
Savannah Guthrie,When did you last remember having a negative test?,,
Donald Trump,"Well, I test quite a bit, and I can tell you that before the debate, which I thought it was a very good debate, and I felt fantastically, I had no problems before.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Did you test the day of the debate?,,
Donald Trump,"I don’t know, I don’t even remember.",,
Donald Trump,I test all the time.,,
Donald Trump,"But I can tell you this, after the debate, I guess a day or so, I think it was Thursday evening, maybe even late Thursday evening, I tested positive.",,
Donald Trump,That’s when I first found out about it.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Well back to the debate, because the debate commission’s rules, it was the honor system.",,
Donald Trump,Yeah.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Would be that you would come with a negative test.,,
Savannah Guthrie,You say you don’t know if you’ve got a test on the day of the debate?,,
Donald Trump,I had no problem.,,
Donald Trump,"Again, the doctors do it.",,
Donald Trump,I don’t ask them.,,
Donald Trump,I test all the time.,,
Donald Trump,And they-,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Did you take a test, though, on the day of the debate?",,
Donald Trump,"If you ask as the doctor, they’ll give you a perfect answer.",,
Donald Trump,But they take a test and I leave and I go about my business.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"So you did you take a test on the day of the debate, I guess is the bottom line?",,
Donald Trump,"I probably did, and I took a test the day before and the day before, and I was always in great shape, and I was in great shape for the debate.",,
Donald Trump,"And it was only after the debate, a period of time after the debate that I said, “That’s interesting.” And they took a test and it tested positive.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Just to button it up, do you take a test every single day?",,
Donald Trump,No.,,
Donald Trump,"No, but I take a lot of tests.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Okay.,,
Savannah Guthrie,And you don’t know if you took a test the day of the debate?,,
Donald Trump,"Possibly I did, possibly I didn’t.",,
Donald Trump,"But the doctor has very accurate information and it’s not only that doctor, it’s many doctors.",,
Donald Trump,"The one thing, if you’re President, you have a lot of doctors you’re surrounded by.",,
Donald Trump,But I was in great shape for the debate.,,
Donald Trump,"And sometime after the debate, I tested positive, then that’s when they decided to, let’s go.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Okay, good.",,
Savannah Guthrie,I hopefully provided some clarity for folks.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Let’s talk about the event that was held at the White House on the Saturday before you tested positive.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Subsequent to that, 13 people connected to that event tested positive.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"There was an outdoor reception, you’ve seen the pictures.",,
Savannah Guthrie,There was an indoor reception.,,
Savannah Guthrie,People were not wearing masks.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"My question to you is, at this point in the pandemic, knowing what we know, shouldn’t you have known better?",,
Savannah Guthrie,Shouldn’t the White House know better than to hold an event like that?,,
Donald Trump,"Well, they do a lot of testing in the White House, they test everybody including me, but they test everybody.",,
Donald Trump,And something happened.,,
Donald Trump,"But as far as the mask is concerned, I’m good with masks.",,
Donald Trump,I’m okay with masks.,,
Donald Trump,"I tell people, wear a mask.",,
Donald Trump,"But just the other day, they came out with a statement that 85% of the people that wear masks catch it.",,
Donald Trump,So this is a very-,,
Savannah Guthrie,It didn’t say that.,,
Savannah Guthrie,I know that study.,,
Donald Trump,"That’s what I heard, and that’s what I saw.",,
Donald Trump,"And regardless, but everybody’s tested and they’re tested often.",,
Donald Trump,"And I also knew that, hey, I’m President.",,
Donald Trump,I have to see people.,,
Donald Trump,I can’t be in a basement.,,
Donald Trump,I can’t be in a room.,,
Donald Trump,I can’t be… I have to be out.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"You can see people with a mask, though, right?",,
Donald Trump,"I can, but people with masks are catching it all the time.",,
Donald Trump,"I mean, if you look at the Governor of Virginia, he was known for a mask.",,
Donald Trump,"If you look at Thom Tillis, a great guy, he always had a mask, and they caught it.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Well, there are pictures of Thom Tillis, actually with one of Judge Barrett’s kids not wearing a mask.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"But you know Chris Christie, he was part of your debate prep.",,
Donald Trump,Yeah.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"He was, I believe at that event.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"He came out tonight, he was sick, very sick.",,
Savannah Guthrie,He was in the hospital for about a week.,,
Donald Trump,"Yes, I know this.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"He came out tonight and said, “I was wrong not to wear a mask.”",,
Donald Trump,"Well, I mean, he has to say that.",,
Donald Trump,"I think it’s great, he’s a friend of mine.",,
Donald Trump,He’s a good guy.,,
Donald Trump,"And wrong or not wrong, you have to understand, as President, I can’t be locked in a room someplace for the next year and just stay and do nothing.",,
Donald Trump,"And every time I go into a crowd, I was with the parents of our fallen heroes.",,
Donald Trump,These people are the most incredible people.,,
Donald Trump,"And they came up to me and they would hug me, and they would touch me, and I’m not to not let them do it, to be honest with you.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Now, there was an event with the gold star families the day after the Supreme Court event.",,
Donald Trump,"There was, exactly right.",,
Donald Trump,We had a gold star event with the most incredible people you’ve ever seen.,,
Donald Trump,"And I could have chosen not to talk to them, or to keep everybody away.",,
Donald Trump,And you know what?,,
Donald Trump,"I don’t think that’s probably where it was caught, but maybe it was.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"I going to say, you bring it up, you brought it up yourself.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"I mean, are you trying to suggest that?",,
Savannah Guthrie,Do you believe a grieving military family gave you a COVID?,,
Donald Trump,"No, I don’t know where it came from, and you don’t know where it came from, and the doctors don’t know where it came from.",,
Donald Trump,"But as the President, I have to be out there.",,
Donald Trump,I also know-,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Well, there’s no one that says you can’t be out there, but it’s just about wearing masks and having… For example, your rallies.",,
Donald Trump,I know this.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Your rallies don’t require masks.,,
Donald Trump,"I mean, let’s see, Kamala.",,
Donald Trump,"She’s got people now, people have it, and I’m not blaming her.",,
Donald Trump,"I’m not saying, “Oh, she did a terrible thing.” As President, I have to be out there.",,
Donald Trump,I can’t be in a basement.,,
Donald Trump,I can’t be locked in a very beautiful room someplace in the White House.,,
Donald Trump,"And I want to see the gold star families, and I want to see everybody.",,
Donald Trump,"And I also say to people all the time, it’s risky doing it.",,
Donald Trump,It is risky doing it.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"But as President, you’re right.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"You want to be a leader, but you also are a leader and a setter of an example.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"And if you’re not wearing a mask when your administration is saying, “Best practice right now is wear a mask,” no, it’s not foolproof.",,
Savannah Guthrie,But that will-,,
Donald Trump,But many people are catching it.,,
Donald Trump,"Many people are getting this disease that was sent to us by China, and it shouldn’t have been allowed to happen.",,
Donald Trump,But many people are getting this.,,
Donald Trump,"And I mean, nobody’s being blamed.",,
Donald Trump,"Everybody is working hard to get this thing out of our country, get it out of the world.",,
Donald Trump,"Look at what’s going on in Europe, massive spikes.",,
Donald Trump,"They’ve done a very good job, but now you take a look today at the UK, you take a look at Spain and France and Italy.",,
Donald Trump,There’s tremendous spikes.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"But our death rate is worse than, well, not Spain, but those other countries.",,
Donald Trump,"Well, I have thing right here that will tell you exactly the opposite.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Me too.,,
Donald Trump,"The UK is up 2500%, because I knew you’d be doing this.",,
Donald Trump,I know you very well.,,
Donald Trump,The UK is up 2500%.,,
Donald Trump,The EU is up 722%.,,
Donald Trump,And the United States is down 21%.,,
Savannah Guthrie,But we have per… Our deaths per capita is among the highest of all-,,
Donald Trump,Excess mortality.,,
Savannah Guthrie,I’m sorry?,,
Donald Trump,"Excess mortality, we’re a winner on the excess mortality.",,
Donald Trump,And what we’ve done has been amazing.,,
Donald Trump,And we have done an amazing job.,,
Donald Trump,"And it’s rounding the corner and we have the vaccines coming, and we have the therapies coming.",,
Donald Trump,"And I’ll tell you what, one thing.",,
Donald Trump,"When I got it, I had a choice.",,
Donald Trump,"Do nothing, or use some of the things that we’re looking at, like in this case, Regeneron.",,
Donald Trump,and Eli Lilly makes something that’s supposed to be incredible.,,
Donald Trump,And I think that maybe I wouldn’t be doing this discussion with you right now.,,
Donald Trump,"We have therapies now and cures, maybe you can use the word cure, but we have therapies that are absolutely incredible, Savannah.",,
Savannah Guthrie,I want to pick up on something you just said.,,
Savannah Guthrie,You said we’re rounding the corner.,,
Donald Trump,"I believe we’re rounding the corner, yes.",,
Savannah Guthrie,10% of the country approximately has had COVID.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"That means 80%-90%, 90%, let’s do the math, is still vulnerable.",,
Donald Trump,"Right, right.",,
Donald Trump,That’s right.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"There’s been some talk, including from the White House lately that perhaps it approves of what’s called herd immunity.",,
Savannah Guthrie,That’s where you basically just let young people and everybody gets sick.,,
Savannah Guthrie,You try to protect the old people and those who are sick.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"And hopefully, it gets up to a certain level, and now we’re all immune.",,
Donald Trump,Yeah.,,
Savannah Guthrie,So let’s just be clear about it.,,
Savannah Guthrie,It also means more deaths.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Do you support herd immunity as a strategy?,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Essentially, just let people get sick?",,
Donald Trump,The cure can not be worse than the problem itself.,,
Donald Trump,We did the right thing.,,
Donald Trump,"We were expected to lose 2,200,000 people, and maybe more than that.",,
Donald Trump,"We’re at 210,000 people.",,
Donald Trump,"One person is too much, it should have never happened because of China.",,
Donald Trump,It happened because of China.,,
Donald Trump,And you have to get that and understand that.,,
Donald Trump,But it shouldn’t have happened.,,
Donald Trump,"But we were expected to lose, if you look at the original charts from original doctors who are respected by everybody, 2,200,00 people.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"That 2 million figure, though, is if you literally did nothing.",,
Donald Trump,We saved 2 million people.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"The 2 million figure is if you did absolutely nothing, it would be 2 million.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"The question is, should the deaths be better than 200,000, when-",,
Donald Trump,"I don’t know, let me tell you what is happening.",,
Donald Trump,"I left North Carolina, which I love.",,
Donald Trump,I left Pennsylvania.,,
Donald Trump,We won a big case in Michigan because that governor has a lockdown where nobody but her husband can do anything.,,
Donald Trump,"He can go boating and do whatever he wants, but nobody else can.",,
Donald Trump,The fact is we’re winning all these cases because it’s unconstitutional what they’re doing.,,
Donald Trump,And I think they’re doing it for political reasons.,,
Donald Trump,"But the fact is the cure, you can’t let this continue to go on with the lockdowns.",,
Donald Trump,"And I believe that on November 4th, you’re going to have a lot of these governors.",,
Donald Trump,Look at what’s happening to New York.,,
Donald Trump,New York is a mess.,,
Donald Trump,"They lost almost 40,000 people.",,
Donald Trump,They have a lockdown like you’ve never seen.,,
Donald Trump,"Now they’re open, it’s like a ghost town.",,
Donald Trump,"And Savannah, it’s very important.",,
Donald Trump,"People are leaving New York by the thousands, and you’re going to have a hard time ever building it up again.",,
Donald Trump,"So that cure, that so called cure that you talk about, it can’t be worse than the problem.",,
Donald Trump,The problem is a bad problem.,,
Savannah Guthrie,We’ve got more questions.,,
Donald Trump,… than the problem.,,
Donald Trump,The problem is a bad problem.,,
Savannah Guthrie,We’ve got more questions on COVID-,,
Donald Trump,"Okay, fine.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"… so let’s drop it, for now.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"We were supposed to, as mentioned, be watching you on a debate stage right now.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"We’re not doing that, so let’s clear up a few things from the last one.",,
Savannah Guthrie,You were asked point blank to denounce white supremacy.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"In the moment, you didn’t.",,
Savannah Guthrie,You asked some follow up questions.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"“Who, specifically?” A couple of days later, on a different show-",,
Donald Trump,"Oh, you always do this.",,
Savannah Guthrie,… you denounced white supremacy.,,
Donald Trump,"No, you always do this.",,
Savannah Guthrie,My question to you is-,,
Donald Trump,"You’ve done this to me, and everybody-",,
Savannah Guthrie,… why does it seem like-,,
Donald Trump,I denounce white supremacy.,,
Donald Trump,Okay?,,
Savannah Guthrie,"You did, two days later.",,
Donald Trump,"I’ve denounced white supremacy, for years, but you always do it.",,
Donald Trump,You always start off with the question.,,
Donald Trump,"You didn’t ask Joe Biden, whether or not he denounces Antifa.",,
Donald Trump,"I watched him on the same basic show with Lester Holt, and he was asking questions like Biden was a child.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Well, so this is a little bit of a dodge.",,
Donald Trump,"So, are you ready?",,
Donald Trump,Are you… Wait.,,
Donald Trump,Are you listening?,,
Donald Trump,I denounce white supremacy.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Okay.,,
Donald Trump,What’s your next question?,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Do you feel, it feels sometimes you’re hesitant to do so, like you wait a beat.",,
Donald Trump,Hesitant?,,
Donald Trump,Here we go again.,,
Donald Trump,"Every time… In fact, my people came, “I’m sure they’ll ask you the white supremacy question.” I denounce white supremacy.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Okay.,,
Donald Trump,"And frankly, you want to know something?",,
Donald Trump,"I denounce Antifa, and I denounce these people on the left that are burning down our cities, that are run by Democrats who don’t know what they’re doing-",,
Savannah Guthrie,"All right, while we’re denouncing, let me ask you about QAnon.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"It is this theory that Democrats are a satanic pedophile ring and that you are the savior, of that.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Now can you just, once and for all, state that that is completely not true, and-",,
Donald Trump,"So, I know [crosstalk 00:18:35]-",,
Savannah Guthrie,… disavow QAnon-,,
Donald Trump,Yeah.,,
Savannah Guthrie,… in its entirety?,,
Donald Trump,I know nothing about QAnon.,,
Savannah Guthrie,I just told you.,,
Donald Trump,I know very little.,,
Donald Trump,"You told me, but what you tell me, doesn’t necessarily make it fact.",,
Donald Trump,I hate to say that.,,
Donald Trump,I know nothing about it.,,
Donald Trump,I do know they are very much against pedophilia.,,
Donald Trump,They fight it very hard.,,
Donald Trump,But I know nothing about it.,,
Donald Trump,If you’d like me to-,,
Savannah Guthrie,They believe that it is a Satanic cult run by the deep state.,,
Donald Trump,… study the subject.,,
Donald Trump,I’ll tell you what I do know about.,,
Donald Trump,"I know about Antifa, and I know about the radical left, and I know how violent they are and how vicious they are.",,
Donald Trump,"And I know how they are burning down cities run by Democrats, not run by Republicans.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Republican Senator Ben Sasse said, quote, “QAnon is nuts and real leaders call conspiracy theories, conspiracy theories.”",,
Donald Trump,He may be right.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Why not just say, it’s crazy and not true?",,
Donald Trump,Can I be honest?,,
Donald Trump,He may be right.,,
Donald Trump,I just don’t know about QAnon.,,
Savannah Guthrie,You do know.,,
Donald Trump,I don’t know.,,
Donald Trump,"No, I don’t know.",,
Donald Trump,I don’t know.,,
Donald Trump,You tell me all about it.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Let me ask you another thing.,,
Donald Trump,Let’s waste the whole show.,,
Donald Trump,You start off with white supremacy.,,
Donald Trump,I denounce it.,,
Donald Trump,You start off with something else.,,
Donald Trump,Let’s go.,,
Donald Trump,Keep asking me these questions.,,
Donald Trump,But let me just-,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Okay, I do have one more in this vein.",,
Donald Trump,… let me just tell you.,,
Donald Trump,"What I do hear about it, is they are very strongly against pedophilia.",,
Donald Trump,And I agree with that.,,
Donald Trump,"I mean, I do agree with that-",,
Savannah Guthrie,Okay.,,
Donald Trump,… and I agree with it very strongly.,,
Savannah Guthrie,But there’s not a Satanic pedophile cult being run by-,,
Donald Trump,I have no idea.,,
Donald Trump,I know nothing about them.,,
Savannah Guthrie,You don’t know that?,,
Savannah Guthrie,Okay.,,
Donald Trump,"No, I don’t know that.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"You, just this week-",,
Donald Trump,"And neither do you, know that.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Okay.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Just this week, you retweeted-",,
Donald Trump,Why aren’t you asking me about Antifa?,,
Donald Trump,Why aren’t you asking me about the radical left?,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Because you just, because you’re volunteering it.",,
Donald Trump,"Why aren’t you asking Joe Biden questions about, why doesn’t he condemn Antifa?",,
Donald Trump,Why does he say it doesn’t exist?,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Because you’re here, before me.",,
Donald Trump,"Antifa, no, excuse me.",,
Donald Trump,That’s so cute.,,
Donald Trump,Antifa exists.,,
Donald Trump,"They’re vicious, they’re violent.",,
Donald Trump,"They kill people, and they’re burning down our cities.",,
Donald Trump,And they happen to be radical left.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Just this week, you retweeted to your 87 million followers, a conspiracy theory that Joe Biden orchestrated to have SEAL Team Six, the Navy SEAL Team Six, killed to cover up the fake death of Bin Laden.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Now, why would you send a lie like that to your followers?",,
Donald Trump,"I know nothing about it, can I [crosstalk 00:20:36]-",,
Savannah Guthrie,You retweeted it.,,
Donald Trump,That was a retweet.,,
Donald Trump,That was an opinion of somebody-,,
Savannah Guthrie,But-,,
Donald Trump,….,,
Donald Trump,and that was a retweet.,,
Donald Trump,I’ll put it out there.,,
Donald Trump,People can decide for themselves.,,
Donald Trump,I don’t take a position.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"I don’t get that, you’re the President.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"You’re not like, someone’s crazy uncle who can just-",,
Donald Trump,"No, no.",,
Donald Trump,"No, no.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"… retweet, whatever.",,
Donald Trump,That was a retweet.,,
Donald Trump,And I do a lot of retweets.,,
Donald Trump,"And frankly, because the media is so fake, and so corrupt, if I didn’t have social media… I don’t call it Twitter, I call it social media.",,
Donald Trump,I wouldn’t be able to get the word out.,,
Donald Trump,And the word is-,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Well, the word is false.",,
Donald Trump,… and you know what the word is?,,
Donald Trump,The word is very simple.,,
Donald Trump,"We’re building our country, stronger and better than it’s ever been before.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Let’s stop-,,
Donald Trump,And that’s what’s happening.,,
Donald Trump,And everybody knows it.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Okay, we’ve got a bunch of questions for you.",,
Donald Trump,You know what else the word is?,,
Donald Trump,We’re winning in a lot of states.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Okay.,,
Donald Trump,We’re winning in a lot of States.,,
Donald Trump,You’re going to see that.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Well, let me ask… Okay.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"I’m glad you brought up the election, because I do want to ask about that.",,
Savannah Guthrie,That’s another kind of leftover item.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"A lot of people have asked you, will you accept a peaceful transfer of power?",,
Savannah Guthrie,"You have said, repeatedly, “The only way we lose this election is, if it is rigged.” Now, that is simply not true.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"The fact is, either candidate can lose fair and square, without ballot fraud.",,
Donald Trump,"Sure, they can.",,
Donald Trump,And do you know what?,,
Savannah Guthrie,"So, will you accept the results of the election?",,
Donald Trump,"Win or lose, that’s the way I want it to be.",,
Donald Trump,"But when I see thousands of ballots, right?",,
Donald Trump,"Unsolicited ballots, being given out by the millions, and thousands of them are dumped in dumpsters.",,
Donald Trump,"And when you see ballots with the name Trump, military ballots, from our great military.",,
Donald Trump,And they’re dumped in garbage cans-,,
Savannah Guthrie,"That is a handful… We could go all night, which we won’t.",,
Donald Trump,"No, no, it’s happening every day.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"But, we could go all night, one by one.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"A single case, a single day.",,
Savannah Guthrie,You’re talking about 150 million votes.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Your own FBI director says, there is no evidence of widespread fraud.",,
Donald Trump,"Oh, really?",,
Donald Trump,"Well, then he’s not doing a very good job.",,
Donald Trump,All you have to do is pick up the papers every day.,,
Donald Trump,"50,000 in Ohio, the great state of Ohio.",,
Donald Trump,"50,000 in another location, I think North Carolina.",,
Donald Trump,"500,000 applications in Virginia.",,
Donald Trump,"No, no, there’s a tremendous problem.",,
Donald Trump,"But let me just tell you, they talk about the peaceful transfer, right?",,
Donald Trump,They spied on my campaign and they got caught.,,
Donald Trump,"And they spied heavily, on my campaign.",,
Donald Trump,And they tried to take down a duly elected sitting president.,,
Donald Trump,"And then, they talk about, “Will you accept a peaceful transfer?” And the answer is, yes, I will.",,
Donald Trump,But I want it to be an honest election.,,
Donald Trump,And so does everybody else.,,
Donald Trump,"When I see thousands of ballots dumped in a garbage can, and they happen to have my name on it?",,
Donald Trump,I’m not happy about that.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Okay, but just… Those are case, there is no, there is in fact, no evidence of widespread fraud.",,
Savannah Guthrie,And you are sowing doubt about our democracy.,,
Donald Trump,"Could I ask you, how can you say that?",,
Savannah Guthrie,Our democracy.,,
Donald Trump,How can you say that?,,
Donald Trump,You do read newspapers?,,
Savannah Guthrie,I do.,,
Donald Trump,You do watch the news?,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Yes, I do.",,
Donald Trump,"I know you read the news, but do you watch it?",,
Savannah Guthrie,I do.,,
Donald Trump,"Because, every day, they’re talking about ballots that are corrupt, that are fraudulent.",,
Savannah Guthrie,And millions that are-,,
Donald Trump,Sure.,,
Savannah Guthrie,… being processed right now.,,
Donald Trump,"Sure, sure.",,
Donald Trump,But you can win a race… Take a look at me.,,
Donald Trump,You can win a race by 1%.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"So why are you laying the groundwork for that, right now?",,
Donald Trump,"I’m not, I don’t want that to happen.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"It’s like, if I go play tennis with my husband and I say, ” My ankle is hurting right now.”",,
Donald Trump,You know what?,,
Donald Trump,I don’t want that to happen.,,
Donald Trump,Savannah.,,
Donald Trump,I want it to be clean.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Okay.,,
Donald Trump,"And I want… I really feel we’re going to win, but I want this to be clean.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Let’s get to questions.,,
Donald Trump,"But it’s sort of ironic that you, and them, talk about the peaceful transfer when I spent three and a half years fighting off these maniacs.",,
Donald Trump,"And now, it turns out, everything’s there.",,
Donald Trump,"That they were the ones that dealt with Russia, and it’s too bad.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Okay.,,
Donald Trump,"Peaceful transfer, I absolutely want that.",,
Donald Trump,"But ideally, I don’t want to transfer, because I want to win.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Yes.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"And I think that, your words will probably reassure some folks.",,

Donald Trump,How are you?,,
Audience Member 12,Welcome to Miami.,,
Donald Trump,"Thank you very much, it’s beautiful.",,
Audience Member 12,"Mr. President, if you knew COVID-19, as you told Bob Woodward in February-",,
Donald Trump,As what?,,
Audience Member 12,"As you told Bob Woodward in February, was airborne and deadlier than the flu, why did you only put in place a travel ban from China, and not put in place other measures mitigating the spread of COVID-19, potentially saving tens of thousands of American lives?",,
Donald Trump,"Well, I did put it in very early, as you know, Joe Biden was two months behind me, and he called me xenophobic and racist and everything else, because I put it in.",,
Donald Trump,And it turned out that I was 100% right.,,
Donald Trump,"I also put it on Europe, very early, because I saw there was a lot of infection in Europe.",,
Donald Trump,And it’s sort of an amazing question.,,
Donald Trump,"And I appreciate the question, and respect the question, but the news doesn’t get out the right answer.",,
Donald Trump,Because I put on a travel ban far earlier than Dr. Fauci thought it was necessary.,,
Donald Trump,Who I like.,,
Donald Trump,Far earlier than the scientists… I was actually the only one that wanted to put it on.,,
Donald Trump,"And I did it, actually against the advice of a lot of people, including Nancy Pelosi who had no clue what she was doing.",,
Donald Trump,"And, Biden.",,
Donald Trump,"When I put on the travel ban… You know, I put it on in January.",,
Donald Trump,The end of January.,,

Savannah Guthrie,Did you [crosstalk 00:25:52]-,,
Donald Trump,"I was early, I was extremely early, when I put on the travel ban.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Can I ask you, did your National Security Advisor, on January 28th in the Oval Office, warn you that this would be the greatest national security risk of your administration?",,
Donald Trump,"I read that, but no, he didn’t.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"He didn’t say it, or you don’t remember?",,
Donald Trump,"I read it… I read it, someplace.",,
Donald Trump,"Maybe Woodward said it, or something.",,
Donald Trump,"But no, he did not say that.",,
Donald Trump,"But, I knew it was a big threat.",,
Donald Trump,"At the same time, I don’t want to panic this country.",,
Donald Trump,"I don’t want to go out and say, “Everybody’s going to die.",,
Donald Trump,Everybody’s going to-”,,
Savannah Guthrie,Isn’t there a middle ground?,,
Donald Trump,Okay?,,
Savannah Guthrie,You don’t have to mislead-,,
Donald Trump,"No, there’s not a middle ground.",,
Savannah Guthrie,… but you can-,,
Donald Trump,"No, no.",,

Savannah Guthrie,"And she is leaning, Biden.",,
Savannah Guthrie,So imagine the dinner table at their house.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Okay?,,
Donald Trump,We’ll talk you out of it.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"So Barbara, why don’t you go first, and ask your question.",,

Audience Member 13,"Our salaries are being cut, and this is also happening another economic sectors as well, including the travel industry and hospitality.",,
Donald Trump,Right.,,
Audience Member 13,"My question to you is, how are you going to get the United States back on track, both in terms of the economy and the pandemic?",,
Donald Trump,"So, it’s happening.",,
Donald Trump,"We just set a record, 11.4 million jobs.",,
Donald Trump,"We are going to have a phenomenal third quarter, which will be announced on November 1st, just prior to the big November 3rd day, where I think you’re going to see a red wave.",,
Donald Trump,But we’re going to have a tremendous announcement.,,
Donald Trump,I believe.,,
Donald Trump,"I mean, we’re going to find out, but GDP is going through the roof.",,
Donald Trump,"Jobs, real estate, houses.",,
Donald Trump,So many things are happening.,,
Donald Trump,"So, people were saying, we’re going to have a 42% unemployment.",,
Donald Trump,"Look, this was a thing that came into our country and it happened a hundred, more than a hundred years ago, and it happened now.",,
Donald Trump,They were talking about a 42% unemployment rate.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Who was talking about that?,,
Donald Trump,"It came out, it just came out-",,
Savannah Guthrie,"I heard, 20%.",,
Donald Trump,"… at 7.8% unemployment, and people can’t even believe it.",,
Donald Trump,"Our economy is going to be… Next year, if we don’t have somebody that raises taxes and quadruples taxes, which they want to do, and it kills everything.",,
Donald Trump,"Our economy is going to be phenomenal, next year.",,
Donald Trump,We’re going to have a phenomenal…,,
Donald Trump,"And, I’ll tell you, Savannah.",,
Donald Trump,"We had the greatest economy in the history of our country last year, including the state of Florida, where we are now.",,
Donald Trump,"In Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, in Ohio, every place.",,
Donald Trump,We had the greatest economy we ever had.,,
Donald Trump,"We had to close it down, we saved two million lives.",,
Donald Trump,We’re opening it up.,,
Donald Trump,We have a V-shape and it’s coming back.,,
Donald Trump,It’s coming back very fast.,,
Donald Trump,"One other thing, we really helped the hospitals.",,

Donald Trump,"In addition, hundreds of millions of masks and gowns.",,
Donald Trump,"And we went into the ventilator business, because this country was not equipped with ventilators.",,
Donald Trump,And I’m not blaming anybody for it.,,
Donald Trump,"But we’re now making thousands of ventilators a month, and we have all we can use.",,

Savannah Guthrie,"Okay, go ahead.",,
Audience Member 14,"Mr. President, my parents are, as you heard, both frontline healthcare workers.",,
Audience Member 14,"And I’ve seen the physical and the mental toll that this pandemic has taken on them, firsthand.",,
Audience Member 14,"As well as the exacerbation of coronavirus, due to Americans who are not wearing masks or participating in social distancing.",,
Audience Member 14,"After contracting COVID-19 yourself, has your opinion changed on the importance of mask wearing?",,
Donald Trump,"No, because I was okay with the masks.",,
Donald Trump,"I was good with it, but I’ve heard many different stories on masks.",,
Donald Trump,"I had, being president, you have people, they bring meals, they bring this, they… And I had an instance recently, where a very wonderful person is bringing me a meal, and he’s playing with his mask.",,
Donald Trump,"And he’s touching his mask, all over the place.",,
Donald Trump,"And then he’s bringing a plate in, and I’m saying, “Well, I don’t know if that’s so good.” I mean, the good news, I didn’t eat it.",,
Donald Trump,Okay?,,
Donald Trump,I decided not to eat it.,,
Donald Trump,This was a month ago.,,
Donald Trump,"But I… Look, look, you have, on the masks, you have two stories.",,
Donald Trump,"You have a story where they want, a story where they don’t want.",,
Donald Trump,I am all for it.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Who is, I don’t get that, because it’s just… All of your public health officials, your administration, they’re in unison about this.",,
Donald Trump,Some.,,
Donald Trump,No.,,
Savannah Guthrie,They’re all in unison about it.,,
Donald Trump,"No, the [crosstalk 00:30:25].",,
Savannah Guthrie,"The University of Washington, which is, they have a model that your coronavirus task force relies on.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Says that, if everyone wore a mask, you could cut expected deaths in half.",,
Donald Trump,"And then, you have other people that disagree.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"60,000 lives.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Well, what does that mean?",,
Donald Trump,"Scott Atkins, if you look at Scott, Dr. Scott.",,
Donald Trump,"He’s from, great guy, Stanford.",,
Donald Trump,"He will tell you that, he disagrees with you.",,
Savannah Guthrie,He’s not an infectious disease expert.,,
Donald Trump,"Oh, I don’t know.",,
Donald Trump,"Look, he’s an expert.",,
Donald Trump,He’s one of the great experts of the world.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"But I don’t get it, because you have so much power and influence as president.",,
Donald Trump,I’m all for it.,,
Savannah Guthrie,And you could go to your… You could require it-,,
Donald Trump,By the way-,,
Savannah Guthrie,"… at your rallies, and you could say-",,
Donald Trump,"I never said, “Don’t wear them.”",,
Savannah Guthrie,"“Everyone put on a mask right now.” And the University of Washington says, you would save lives.",,
Donald Trump,"Savannah, University of Washington.",,
Donald Trump,"And then, you have other places, say different things.",,
Donald Trump,You have a lot of… Hey.,,
Donald Trump,"Dr. Fauci said, “Don’t wear a mask,” right?",,
Savannah Guthrie,"At first, but then everybody agreed.",,
Donald Trump,"Oh, I don’t know.",,
Donald Trump,Then he changed his mind.,,
Donald Trump,"But then, you have a report coming out two days ago, that 85% of the people wearing masks catch it.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"I looked at that report, it’s not about mask wearing.",,
Savannah Guthrie,It was neutral on the question of masks.,,
Donald Trump,Savannah.,,
Donald Trump,We’re on the same side.,,
Donald Trump,"I say, wear the mask.",,
Donald Trump,I’m fine with it.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Okay.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Okay.,,
Donald Trump,I have no problem.,,
Donald Trump,We’re on the same side.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Let’s take a break.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"We’re going to get more questions, right after this.",,
Donald Trump,Thank you.,,
Donald Trump,(silence).,,
Savannah Guthrie,And we’re back.,,
Savannah Guthrie,We’re live in Miami with President Trump for a town hall.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Live in Miami with President Trump for a town hall.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Thank you again, Mr. President.",,
Savannah Guthrie,We have another voter.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Now, Christie Alonzo, come on out, Christie, she is leaning slightly towards you, she says.",,
Savannah Guthrie,She voted for you in 2016.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Christie, you ready?",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Take the mask off, hold the mic close, and let’s hear your question.",,
Audience Member 15,"Thank you for your service, Mr. President.",,
Donald Trump,Thank you.,,
Donald Trump,Thank you very much.,,
Audience Member 15,We’re a hard-working middle-class family of four.,,
Audience Member 15,"My husband and I are both self-employed, and we have to get our own individual healthcare.",,
Audience Member 15,"As you know, healthcare costs have gone up considerably over the decades.",,
Audience Member 15,And you had originally said you were going to repeal and replace Obamacare.,,
Audience Member 15,What is your plan now in 2020 to make healthcare costs affordable for Americans like myself?,,
Donald Trump,Good.,,
Donald Trump,"So we got rid of the individual mandate on Obamacare, which was the worst part of Obamacare, and now you could actually say it’s not Obamacare because that’s how big it was, where you had to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance, so we got rid of that.",,
Donald Trump,"That was a big, big thing.",,
Donald Trump,"And by doing that, and we will always have… By the way, we’re always protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and I can’t say that more strongly, but we’ve been able to bring healthcare costs way down.",,
Donald Trump,"Now, I took over Obamacare, got rid of the individual mandate, made it good, managed it much better.",,
Donald Trump,"Remember, they had the $5 billion website disaster, and all of the problems they had.",,
Donald Trump,"The problem with Obamacare, it’s not good.",,
Donald Trump,"We’d like to terminate it, and we want a much less expensive healthcare that’s a much better healthcare, and that’s where we’re aiming.",,
Donald Trump,"And if we can do that, and we have a very good chance of doing it, but we’ve also brought down the price of Obamacare.",,
Donald Trump,"The problem with Obamacare, it basically is never going to be great, and I want to give great healthcare.",,
Donald Trump,So important.,,
Donald Trump,And thank you very much.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Mr. President, I got a follow-up pre-existing conditions.",,
Savannah Guthrie,This is such a big issue for voters.,,
Donald Trump,It is a big issue for me too.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"In point of fact, your administration is about to go to the Supreme Court to argue to throw out the rest of Obamacare, which includes the protections for preexisting conditions.",,
Donald Trump,That’s right.,,
Donald Trump,That’s right.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"So your administration is in court right now, trying to get rid of that protection.",,
Donald Trump,In order to replace it with a much better healthcare at a much lower price.,,
Donald Trump,"And always, under all circumstances, we are going to protect the Republicans.",,
Donald Trump,"And maybe I changed the party a lot over the last three years, but we will protect people with preexisting conditions.",,
Donald Trump,"And Savannah, what I want to do, get rid of the terrible Obamacare.",,
Donald Trump,"I’ve already done it to a large extent because as you know, the individual mandate is gone.",,
Donald Trump,That was the worst part.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"You repealed, but you haven’t replaced.",,
Donald Trump,"No, no.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Now, you’ve been in office almost four years.",,
Donald Trump,We have done-,,
Savannah Guthrie,"You have both houses of Congress, Senate and House, in Republican hands, and there is not a replacement yet.",,
Donald Trump,That’s right.,,
Donald Trump,"I’m sorry, but if you look, we had both houses and what did we do?",,
Donald Trump,We got rid of the individual mandate.,,
Donald Trump,That went through the legislature.,,
Savannah Guthrie,But the promise was repeal and replace.,,
Donald Trump,"Look, look.",,
Donald Trump,We should be on the same side.,,
Donald Trump,I wanted very simple.,,
Donald Trump,I’m going to put it very simple.,,
Donald Trump,"We would like to terminate it, and we would like to replace it with something that’s much less expensive and much better.",,
Donald Trump,We will always protect people with preexisting conditions.,,
Savannah Guthrie,But if you’re successful in court-,,
Donald Trump,And here’s the thing-,,
Savannah Guthrie,"… in November, those preexisting conditions, that promise will be gone.",,
Donald Trump,"If we don’t succeed, we are running the remnants of whatever’s left because we took it apart.",,
Donald Trump,"We are running the remnants of whatever’s left much better than the previous administration, which ran it very badly, but we’d like to have new healthcare much better and much less expensive.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Let me get to question number five.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"And you’ll like this, he’s stuck in traffic.",,
Savannah Guthrie,His name is Joe White.,,
Savannah Guthrie,He is registered as a Democrat.,,
Savannah Guthrie,He says he’s leaning toward Biden and voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"And his question was a, a second stimulus payment has been broadly agreed upon by the Republicans and Democrats, and yet, now we’re in October and it’s still not passed.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Why not use your office to make the second stimulus payment a separate targeted emergency relief package to help Americans weather the pandemic?,,
Donald Trump,"Well, we’ve actually passed three packages, and we’re on our fourth, and I agree with him 100%.",,
Donald Trump,He should vote for me.,,
Donald Trump,The problem you have is Nancy Pelosi.,,
Donald Trump,She couldn’t care less about the worker.,,
Donald Trump,She couldn’t care less about our people.,,
Donald Trump,"And we should have a stimulus, and I want a stimulus.",,
Donald Trump,The Republicans will approve a stimulus.,,
Donald Trump,The problem is she doesn’t want to do it because she thinks it’s bad for her election.,,
Donald Trump,"The fact is, she’s wrong because people know she’s in our way, she’s not approving it, she doesn’t appreciate our people, and she doesn’t appreciate, at all, our workers.",,
Donald Trump,"Nancy Pelosi, we are ready to sign and pass stimulus, but she’s got to approve it.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"People do not love the back and forth of Washington, but this has been a rollercoaster.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Back in early October, you one day tweeted, “No more negotiations until after election day.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"I’m walking away.” Then, I think the next couple of days you said, “Maybe we can do something targeted.”",,
Donald Trump,That’s right.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Then you said, “I want a big, big bill.” But then Senate Republicans said, “No, we’re not for that.” So you are the big deal-maker.",,
Savannah Guthrie,How come this is so… You yourself had changed positions.,,
Donald Trump,That’s right.,,
Donald Trump,Did you ever hear a word called negotiation when negotiating?,,
Donald Trump,Okay.,,
Donald Trump,I’m negotiating-,,
Savannah Guthrie,But people’s lives are hanging in the balance.,,
Donald Trump,You know what?,,
Donald Trump,And you know who I’m negotiating against?,,
Donald Trump,"Nancy Pelosi, because she doesn’t want to give them money.",,
Donald Trump,We should have stimulus.,,
Donald Trump,This was not our people’s fault.,,
Donald Trump,This was China’s fault.,,
Donald Trump,And she’s penalizing our people.,,
Donald Trump,"I’m ready to sign a big, beautiful stimulus.",,
Donald Trump,"You saw the other day, I said, “Go big or go home.” Right?",,
Savannah Guthrie,That’s what I was talking about.,,
Donald Trump,I want it to be big.,,
Donald Trump,I want it to be bold.,,
Donald Trump,I want the money to go to directly to the people.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Senate Republicans with you, they’re going to go big?",,
Donald Trump,They’ll go.,,
Donald Trump,"Yeah, they’ll go.",,
Donald Trump,They’ll go.,,
Donald Trump,They’re going be very active-,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Okay, because so far, they have not said they would.",,
Donald Trump,"I know, because I haven’t asked them to because I can’t get through Nancy Pelosi.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Okay.,,
Donald Trump,"If Nancy Pelosi and I, through my representatives or directly, I don’t care, if we agree to something, the Republicans will agree to it.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Okay.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Our next question comes from… Oh, this is interesting.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"She voted for Clinton in 2016, but recently changed her registration from Democrat to Independent.",,
Savannah Guthrie,She says she’s truly undecided.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Her name’s Becky Lightman.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Hello, Becky.",,
Savannah Guthrie,What’s your question?,,
Donald Trump,How are you?,,
Audience Member 13,"Hi, I’m great.",,
Audience Member 13,How are you?,,
Donald Trump,Nice to see you.,,
Donald Trump,Thank you.,,
Audience Member 13,Good to see you.,,
Audience Member 13,So corporate tax rates are a hot button issue and you have cut corporate tax rates.,,
Audience Member 13,"And your opponent, Joe Biden, is planning to raise them.",,
Audience Member 13,A lot of Americans think that corporations don’t pay their share of taxes and want to see those tax rates increase.,,
Audience Member 13,What do you say to those Americans to maybe tell them why you want the corporate tax rate lower and why that helps them?,,
Donald Trump,It’s a great question.,,
Donald Trump,We’ve created more jobs than this country has ever created.,,
Donald Trump,We were up to 160 million jobs.,,
Donald Trump,We were never even close to that number.,,
Donald Trump,"We were just hitting 160 million jobs, companies are pouring into our nation because of the tax rate, and if Biden comes in and raises taxes on everybody, including middle income taxes, which he wants to do, you will blow this thing, and you’ll end up with a depression, the likes of which you’ve never had.",,
Donald Trump,That’s what’s going to happen.,,
Donald Trump,We have something that’s really good.,,
Donald Trump,The reason we’re coming back so strong is because we built a very strong foundation.,,
Donald Trump,Companies are moving in.,,
Donald Trump,"Car companies are moving into Michigan, into Ohio, into South Carolina, and North Carolina just today, so what’s happening is, they’re coming in because we reduced the taxes.",,
Donald Trump,"Our taxes, our corporate taxes were the highest in the world, and now they’re among the lower taxes.",,
Donald Trump,"They’re not the lowest, but they’re among the lowest.",,
Donald Trump,"And what that means, is jobs, but also we’re doing a very big, and we’ve done a very big, middle income tax package.",,
Donald Trump,"So if we get in, we’re going to do the middle income tax package, but it’s a great question.",,
Donald Trump,"And if he comes along and raises rates, all those companies that are coming in, they will leave the U.S. so fast your head will spin.",,
Donald Trump,We can’t let that happen.,,
Donald Trump,Thank you.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"On the subject of taxes, as you know, the New York times has obtained, it says years of your tax returns among other things, it says that you have debts of approximately $421 million that you have personally guaranteed, and that will come due in the next four years.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"The question is, on behalf of voters, who do you owe $421 million to?",,
Donald Trump,"Okay, first of all, let me answer.",,
Donald Trump,"What they did is illegal, number one.",,
Donald Trump,"Also, the numbers are all wrong, with the numbers they released.",,
Donald Trump,"And just so you understand, when you have a lot of real estate, I have real estate, you know a lot of it.",,
Donald Trump,Okay?,,
Donald Trump,"Right down the road, Doral, big stuff, great stuff.",,
Donald Trump,"When I decided to run, I’m very underlevered, fortunately, but I’m very underlevered.",,
Donald Trump,"I have a very, very small percentage of debt compared.",,
Donald Trump,"In fact, some of it, I did as favors to institutions that wanted to loan me money.",,
Donald Trump,"$400 million compared to the assets that I have, all of these great properties all over the world, and frankly, The Bank of America building in San Francisco.",,
Donald Trump,I don’t love what’s happening to San Francisco.,,
Donald Trump,"1290 Avenue of the Americas, one of the biggest office buildings.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Well do I hear you right?,,
Savannah Guthrie,It sounds like you’re saying $400 million isn’t that much.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"But are you confirming that, yes, you do owe some $400 million?",,
Donald Trump,"What I’m saying is that, it’s a tiny percentage of my net worth.",,
Savannah Guthrie,That sounds like yes.,,
Donald Trump,And you’ll see that soon because we’re doing things.,,
Donald Trump,"We’ve given, I think it’s 108 or 112 pages of financial detail to elections, and we have to file as the president, as any politician, you have to file.",,
Donald Trump,Nobody ever looks at that.,,
Donald Trump,"When they do, they see how incredible a company is, but more importantly, they see where this debt is.",,
Donald Trump,"No, I don’t owe Russia money.",,
Donald Trump,"I owe a very, very small… It’s called mortgages.",,
Donald Trump,"People have a house, they put a mortgage.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Any foreign bank?,,
Savannah Guthrie,Any foreign entity?,,
Donald Trump,"Not that I know of, but I will probably, because it’s so easy to solve, and if you’d like to do, I will let you know who I owe, whatever small amount of money.",,
Donald Trump,I want to say two things.,,
Donald Trump,"Number one, it’s a very small amount of money.",,
Donald Trump,"Number two, it’s very straight.",,
Donald Trump,"It’s very, very straight, but it’s a tiny percentage of the worth.",,
Donald Trump,Did you ever hear the expression underlevered?,,
Savannah Guthrie,Yeah.,,
Donald Trump,I am extremely underlevered.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Well, here’s the thing.",,
Savannah Guthrie,You could clear this up tonight by just releasing your tax returns yourself.,,
Savannah Guthrie,That’s what I don’t understand.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"I think people are just wondering, you’re the only-",,
Donald Trump,"As you know, I’m under audit.",,
Donald Trump,It turned out that I am under audit.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Yes, but the IRS said… You are.",,
Donald Trump,But they actually… Excuse me.,,
Donald Trump,"No, no.",,
Savannah Guthrie,But the IRS says that doesn’t stop you from releasing.,,
Donald Trump,But you accused me of not being under audit previously.,,
Savannah Guthrie,I did not.,,
Donald Trump,And so did other people at NBC.,,
Donald Trump,And I am under audit.,,
Savannah Guthrie,You are.,,
Donald Trump,So that one’s solved.,,
Donald Trump,That’s good.,,
Donald Trump,I am under audit.,,
Donald Trump,"No person in their right mind would release, prior to working out the deal with the IRS.",,
Donald Trump,And I’ll go a step further.,,
Donald Trump,I’m treated very badly by the IRS.,,
Donald Trump,"They treat me very, very badly.",,
Donald Trump,"You have people in there from previous administrations that treat me very badly, but we’re under audit.",,
Donald Trump,"It’s very routine, in many ways, but we’re under audit.",,
Donald Trump,"They like to change the game, change the rules, do everything.",,
Donald Trump,You saw what they did with the tea party people.,,
Donald Trump,You saw what they did with the religious group.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"But to be clear, there is no law or rule that prohibits you from releasing your tax returns.",,
Donald Trump,"No, except common sense, and intelligence, and having lawyers that say… Because I would love to release them, and as soon as we come to a conclusion, I will release them, and very gladly, but if you go to elections, and if you take a look, you’ll see 112, I think it’s 112, it talks about the income, which is rather massive.",,
Donald Trump,It talks about all of the properties.,,
Donald Trump,They have them listed.,,
Donald Trump,"You can never learn more, but you know what happened?",,
Donald Trump,People went there.,,
Donald Trump,All the reporters went.,,
Donald Trump,There was a feeding frenzy.,,
Donald Trump,"This was originally, when I filed it.",,
Donald Trump,And I filed it every year.,,
Donald Trump,I update it every year.,,
Donald Trump,My son is here.,,
Donald Trump,They run the company.,,
Donald Trump,I don’t run the company.,,
Savannah Guthrie,It also says that you’ve paid $750 in taxes in the year you were elected.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Is that true or not?,,
Donald Trump,"Yeah, because that’s a statutory number.",,
Donald Trump,It’s a statutory.,,
Savannah Guthrie,But is that true?,,
Donald Trump,I think it’s a filing number.,,
Donald Trump,"You pay 750, it’s a filing or a filing fee.",,
Savannah Guthrie,But is that all you paid?,,
Savannah Guthrie,Because most people here probably paid more.,,
Donald Trump,"No, I don’t know.",,
Donald Trump,I can tell you this.,,
Donald Trump,"If they have my tax returns, as you know, they have to go to jail.",,
Donald Trump,"It’s illegal, but their numbers were wrong, but let me tell you what else.",,
Donald Trump,I don’t owe money to any of these sinister people.,,
Donald Trump,This has been going on for years now.,,
Donald Trump,"Russia, Russia, Russia.",,
Donald Trump,"It turned out to be a hoax, and it turned out to be that Hillary Clinton and the Democrats were dealing with Russia, not me.",,
Donald Trump,It’s a whole hoax.,,
Donald Trump,"So I would not mind at all saying who it is, but it’s a very small… When you look at vast properties like I have, and they’re big, and they’re beautiful, and they’re well located.",,
Donald Trump,"When you look at that, the amount of money, $400 million is a peanut.",,
Donald Trump,It’s extremely underlevered.,,
Donald Trump,And it’s levered with normal banks.,,
Donald Trump,Not a big deal.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"All right, let’s take a break.",,
Savannah Guthrie,We’ll get more voter questions right after this.,,
Donald Trump,Thank you.,,
Donald Trump,Thank you.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"We are live in Miami, in the middle of a town hall with President Trump.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Thank you again-,,
Savannah Guthrie,We are live in Miami in the middle of a town hall with President Trump.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Thank you again for being here.,,
Donald Trump,Thank you.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"We’ve got another voter, Adam Schucher.",,
Savannah Guthrie,He voted for Clinton in 2016.,,
Savannah Guthrie,He’s registered as a Democrat and says he’s supporting Biden.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Adam, take it away.",,
Audience Member 16,"Thank you, Savannah.",,
Audience Member 16,"Thank you, Mr. President.",,
Donald Trump,"Thank you, Adam.",,
Audience Member 16,"Four years ago, Senate leadership said it was inappropriate to push through a nominee in an election year, yet they fast-tracked your nominee for the Supreme Court just today.",,
Audience Member 16,"The question I have for you is, what do you say to the voter that thinks it’s hypocritical to act in that manner and that they can’t trust Republicans’ word?",,
Donald Trump,"So when I was elected, and when a president is elected, they’re elected for a period of four years.",,
Donald Trump,And Justice Ginsburg said it best.,,
Donald Trump,"I think, talking about president Obama having to do with somebody else, that the president is put there for four years, not for three years.",,
Donald Trump,"So during this fourth year, it happened to come up, unfortunately, because I had great respect for Justice Ginsburg.",,
Donald Trump,"But a vacancy happened to come up, and we picked somebody that’s outstanding.",,
Donald Trump,"She has been an absolute star, and I’m extremely proud of it.",,
Donald Trump,"But again, plenty of time.",,
Donald Trump,There’s plenty of time.,,
Donald Trump,"We’re going to do it before the election, but we also have much time after the election.",,
Donald Trump,"But there’s no reason to wait, because it’s almost unanimous, it seems to me, certainly within the Republican party.",,
Donald Trump,"And frankly, most of the Democrats within closed rooms, I guarantee you that.",,
Donald Trump,"This is an outstanding person, and I’m using my fourth term.",,
Donald Trump,"And if you look at it and if you put the shoe on the other foot, if they had this, they would do it 100%.",,
Donald Trump,So there’s been 29 times when this has happened.,,
Donald Trump,All 29 times a president has done exactly what I’ve done.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"To the voter’s point, I’ll just say that in 2016, you were on another show, actually another morning show, and you were asked whether President Obama should nominate a Supreme Court Justice Merrick Garland.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"And you said, “I think the Senate should wait until the next president, and let the president pick.” Now that was eight months before the election.",,
Savannah Guthrie,This is three weeks before the election.,,
Donald Trump,"So I have a lot of respect, by the way, for-",,
Savannah Guthrie,So you have changed your position on this?,,
Donald Trump,I have a lot of respect for Judge Garland.,,
Donald Trump,I want to tell you that.,,
Donald Trump,"But I’ll tell you, the whole ball game changed when I saw the way they treated Justice Kavanaugh.",,
Donald Trump,"I have never seen any human being, and I’m not just talking about Supreme Court… I have never seen a human being treated so badly with false accusations and everything else.",,
Donald Trump,I have never seen anything like it.,,
Donald Trump,"And you know what the truth is, Savannah?",,
Donald Trump,"Like it or not, the ball game changed a lot.",,
Donald Trump,"There has never been anybody treated so badly as, now Justice Kavanaugh.",,
Savannah Guthrie,You’ve mentioned that you would like to see Amy Coney Barrett confirmed to the Supreme Court in case any challenges come up in connection with the election.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Do you expect her to rule for you?,,
Donald Trump,"Well, I think she’ll have to make that decision.",,
Donald Trump,I don’t think she has any conflict at all.,,
Donald Trump,A Supreme Court judge does not have… They can make their own decision.,,
Donald Trump,They actually have additional power to make that decision.,,
Donald Trump,It would be totally up to her.,,
Donald Trump,"I would think that she would be able to rule either for me or against me, being I don’t see any conflict whatsoever.",,
Donald Trump,We have an election coming up.,,
Donald Trump,I think it’s the most important election in the history of our country.,,
Donald Trump,"If for any chance, and it probably won’t… And I hope it doesn’t ever get to the Supreme Court.",,
Donald Trump,"But if it did, I would think that she would rule one way or the other.",,
Donald Trump,I would think so.,,
Savannah Guthrie,But for you?,,
Savannah Guthrie,You think she would rule for you?,,
Donald Trump,I have no idea.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Of course she’ll rule one way or the other, but-",,
Donald Trump,"Because believe it or not, I never asked her about it.",,
Donald Trump,I never talked about it.,,
Donald Trump,I didn’t talk about any of the obvious things that you could talk about.,,
Donald Trump,And I think a lot of people in my position might.,,
Donald Trump,"But in speaking to a lot of very brilliant people and people that do this for a living, they say it’s better not to talk.",,
Donald Trump,So I talked to her about life.,,
Donald Trump,"I talked to her about the fact, “Would you like to do this?",,
Donald Trump,Are you willing to do this?” Because it’s a tremendous burden.,,
Donald Trump,"The answer was, “Yes.” She’s unbelievably well-qualified, but I never spoke to her about these various questions.",,
Savannah Guthrie,Let’s get our next voter.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"She’s leaning to you, Mr. President.",,
Savannah Guthrie,She voted for you in 2016.,,
Savannah Guthrie,She is a registered Republican.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Her name is Moriah Greene.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Mariah, what’s your question?",,
Donald Trump,Thank you very much.,,
Audience Member 17,Thank you.,,
Audience Member 17,"Good evening, Mr. President.",,
Audience Member 17,"I’m honored to be with you here tonight, sir.",,
Audience Member 17,So thank you.,,
Audience Member 17,I’m a pro-life millennial.,,
Audience Member 17,"And my question for you today is, if Roe v. Wade is ultimately overturned in the future, what protections would be put in place or kept for where the mother’s life is in jeopardy in relation to high risk pregnancies?",,
Donald Trump,"Well, again, I’m not ruling on this.",,
Donald Trump,"And Roe v. Wade is something that a lot of people would say, obviously, you’re going to speak to somebody.",,
Donald Trump,"Also two other great Justices, Justice Gorsuch, and Justice Kavanaugh… I never spoke to them about Roe v. Wade.",,
Donald Trump,I never spoke to them about election laws.,,
Donald Trump,I never spoke to them about anything.,,
Donald Trump,And I’ve done the right thing from a moral standpoint.,,
Donald Trump,"I don’t even know from a legal standpoint, but it was the right thing.",,
Donald Trump,"I think, depending on what happens with Roe v. Wade, I think that perhaps it could get sent down to the states, and the states would decide.",,
Donald Trump,I also think perhaps nothing will happen.,,
Donald Trump,I have not talked to her about it.,,
Donald Trump,I think it would be inappropriate to talk to her about it.,,
Donald Trump,"And some people would say, “You can talk to about it.” I just think it would be inappropriate.",,
Savannah Guthrie,But what is your preference?,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Because agreed, that’s not something you should talk to the judge about.",,
Savannah Guthrie,But would you like to see Roe versus Wade overturned?,,
Donald Trump,"I would like to see a brilliant jurist, a brilliant person who has done this in great depth and has actually skirted this issue for a long time, make a decision.",,
Donald Trump,And that’s why I chose her.,,
Donald Trump,I think that she’s going to make a great decision.,,
Donald Trump,I did not tell her what decision to make.,,
Donald Trump,"And I think it would be inappropriate to say right now, because I don’t want to do anything to influence her.",,
Donald Trump,"I want her to get approved, and then I want her to go by the law.",,
Donald Trump,"And I know she’s going to make a great decision for our country, along with the other two people I put there.",,
Savannah Guthrie,You’re running as a pro-life Republican.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Most pro-life Republicans would like to see Roe v. Wade overturned and abortion banned.,,
Donald Trump,Many of them would.,,
Donald Trump,Perhaps most of them would.,,
Donald Trump,"I am telling you, I don’t want to do anything to influence anything right now.",,
Donald Trump,"I don’t want to go out tomorrow and say, “Oh, he’s trying to give her a signal.” Because I didn’t speak to her about it.",,
Donald Trump,I’ve done the right thing in so doing.,,
Donald Trump,"How she’s going to rule, you’re going to find out perhaps.",,
Donald Trump,Or you might not find out.,,
Donald Trump,It may never get there.,,
Donald Trump,It may never get there.,,
Donald Trump,We’ll see what happens.,,
Savannah Guthrie,All right.,,
Savannah Guthrie,We have another question.,,
Savannah Guthrie,This is Cindy Velez.,,
Savannah Guthrie,She is undecided.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"She says she’s leaning to Biden, and she did vote for Clinton in 2016.",,
Savannah Guthrie,She’s registered as a Democrat.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Hi Cindy.,,
Savannah Guthrie,What’s your question?,,
Audience Member 18,"Good evening, Savannah.",,
Donald Trump,"Hi, Cindy.",,
Donald Trump,Thank you.,,
Audience Member 18,"Good evening, Mr. President.",,
Donald Trump,Thank you very much.,,
Audience Member 18,"As the mother of a young male of color, I have reason to respect authority, not only because it’s the right thing to do, but also out of fear that he may face profiling or be considered a criminal.",,
Audience Member 18,"As an educator, I’ve also had similar conversations with my high school students.",,
Audience Member 18,"Mr. President, what will you and your administration do to better prepare our law enforcement officers to work in collaboration with the communities that they serve and also to protect the lives of innocent Black and Latinos from police brutality and injustice?",,
Donald Trump,Right.,,
Donald Trump,"I fully understand the question, and I saw everything that you saw over the summer.",,
Donald Trump,"And it was a terrible thing, a terrible thing to watch.",,
Donald Trump,We have a Senator named Tim Scott from South Carolina.,,
Donald Trump,He came up with a bill that should have been approved.,,
Donald Trump,It was great.,,
Donald Trump,"It was a bill that was strong in terms of law enforcement, and strong in terms of enforcing the proper thing, and doing the proper thing by law enforcement.",,
Donald Trump,And the Democrats just wouldn’t go for it.,,
Donald Trump,They wouldn’t go for it at all.,,
Donald Trump,"And I don’t know why, because it was a really great bill.",,
Donald Trump,But I do have to say this.,,
Donald Trump,"And some people don’t like it when I say it, but a lot of people agree.",,
Donald Trump,I have done more for the African American community than any president.,,
Donald Trump,With the exception of Abraham Lincoln.,,
Donald Trump,"Criminal justice reform, prison reform, historically Black colleges and universities.",,
Donald Trump,I got them funded.,,
Donald Trump,They were on a year to year basis.,,
Donald Trump,They could have been put out of business.,,
Donald Trump,"As soon as our country had a little bad year, they would have said, “I’m sorry, we’re not going to fund you.” I got them 10 year funding and financing.",,
Donald Trump,And more than they even asked for.,,
Donald Trump,I became very friendly with a lot of the heads.,,
Donald Trump,"But we’ve done more… And of course, opportunity zones.",,
Donald Trump,"But criminal justice reform, everybody said it could not be done.",,
Donald Trump,President Obama and Biden never even tried to do it.,,
Donald Trump,They never even tried.,,
Donald Trump,"But I say that, and I say it often.",,
Donald Trump,"I’ll say it loud, and I’m very proud of it.",,
Donald Trump,And I have a great relationship because of what I’ve done with the African-American community.,,
Donald Trump,I’m very proud of it.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Let’s go to our next question.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"We have Paulette Dale, she leans slightly to Biden.",,
Savannah Guthrie,She voted for Clinton in 2016.,,
Savannah Guthrie,She’s registered as a Republican.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Paulette, what’s your question?",,
Audience Member 19,Thank you.,,
Audience Member 19,"Good evening, Mr. President.",,
Donald Trump,Thank you.,,
Donald Trump,Thank you very much.,,
Audience Member 19,"I have to say, you have a great smile.",,
Donald Trump,Got you.,,
Donald Trump,Thank you.,,
Audience Member 19,He does.,,
Audience Member 19,You’re so handsome when you smile.,,
Audience Member 19,"As the daughter of immigrants to the United States who fled Eastern Europe due to religious persecution, the United States immigration policies are very personal for me.",,
Donald Trump,Right.,,
Audience Member 19,"Surveys show that most Americans, and the majority of Republicans, support the Dreamers program.",,
Audience Member 19,"So my question for you, Mr. President, is if you are elected to a second term, do you expect to pursue your previous efforts to cut the DACA program?",,
Donald Trump,Yeah.,,
Audience Member 19,Why or why not?,,
Donald Trump,DACA is somewhat different than Dreamers.,,
Donald Trump,"You understand that, and you understand it better than anybody, probably, in this room.",,
Donald Trump,"Where do you come from, by the way, originally?",,
Donald Trump,Where?,,
Audience Member 19,My grandparents were from Russia and Poland.,,
Donald Trump,That’s very good.,,
Donald Trump,Okay.,,
Donald Trump,So we are going to take care of DACA.,,
Donald Trump,We’re going to take care of Dreamer.,,
Donald Trump,It’s working right now.,,
Donald Trump,We’re negotiating different aspects of immigration and immigration law.,,
Donald Trump,"We’ve built now, over 400 miles of border wall, southern border.",,
Donald Trump,Mexico is working very closely with us.,,
Donald Trump,We have the strongest border we’ve ever had.,,
Donald Trump,We want people to come into our country.,,
Donald Trump,They have to come in legally.,,
Donald Trump,But we are working very hard on the DACA program.,,
Donald Trump,"And you will be, I think, very happy over the course of the next year.",,
Audience Member 19,Thank you.,,
Donald Trump,Because I feel the same way as you do about it.,,
Audience Member 19,"Thank you, Mr. President.",,
Donald Trump,Thank you.,,
Donald Trump,Thank you very much.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Mr. President, in point of fact, the DACA program… Under your administration, no new applicants are allowed.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"And in fact, the DACA recipients now have to renew every year as opposed to every two years.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"So in fact, the DACA program has been curtailed by your administration.",,
Donald Trump,"Well, what happens is because of the pandemic, much changed on the immigration front.",,
Donald Trump,"Mexico is heavily infected, as you know.",,
Donald Trump,"And we’ve made it very, very difficult to come in because of the pandemic, and other reasons, and crime.",,
Donald Trump,"But we have a very strong border right now, and we have to keep it that way.",,
Donald Trump,"But we want people to come into our country, but they have to come in through a merit system, and they have to come in legally.",,
Donald Trump,"And people are very, very happy with it.",,
Donald Trump,You haven’t heard any complaints about that.,,
Donald Trump,"But what happened is because of the pandemic, we have to be extra cautious.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"You have been promising this immigration bill since, well, at least July, when you told my colleague on Telemundo it was coming.",,
Savannah Guthrie,But nothing’s come yet.,,
Donald Trump,It’s very happy.,,
Donald Trump,"The fact is, we got rid of catch and release, which is a disaster.",,
Donald Trump,You catch somebody.,,
Donald Trump,They could be a murderer.,,
Donald Trump,"That could be a rapist, and we’re supposed to release them into our country.",,
Donald Trump,These are the laws that I inherited.,,
Donald Trump,We ended that program.,,
Donald Trump,"Now, I think you’re going to see something very, very good.",,
Donald Trump,"The whole immigration… If you look at what’s going on, people used to pour into our country.",,
Donald Trump,"And especially during the pandemic, I think even you, Savannah, will be very impressed with what we’ve done.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Sir, we have about 30 seconds left.",,
Donald Trump,Sure.,,
Savannah Guthrie,I think about people sitting out there tonight.,,
Savannah Guthrie,There are some who love you.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Some of them are sitting right around here, and some who will never vote for you.",,
Savannah Guthrie,But there are people in the middle.,,
Savannah Guthrie,There are people who aren’t sure.,,
Donald Trump,That’s right.,,
Savannah Guthrie,There are people who want to know why they should give you a second chance and how you might improve in a second term.,,
Savannah Guthrie,30 seconds.,,
Savannah Guthrie,What would you say to them?,,
Donald Trump,Because I’ve done a great job.,,
Donald Trump,We have the strongest economy in the world.,,
Donald Trump,We closed it up.,,
Donald Trump,We are coming around the corner.,,
Donald Trump,"The vaccines are coming out soon, and our economy is strong.",,
Donald Trump,We are at a level with jobs like we’ve never been before.,,
Donald Trump,We’ve rebuilt our military.,,
Donald Trump,We’ve rebuilt our borders.,,
Donald Trump,We had no borders.,,
Donald Trump,We had no nothing.,,
Donald Trump,We’ve rebuilt so much.,,
Donald Trump,We’ve given you the greatest tax cut in the history of our country.,,
Donald Trump,"Greatest regulation cut, equally as important.",,
Donald Trump,And we created new levels of jobs that nobody thought was possible.,,
Donald Trump,And next year is going to be better than ever before.,,
Savannah Guthrie,I got to leave it there.,,
Savannah Guthrie,I got a wrap from the control room.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"Mr. President, thank you for your time.",,
Donald Trump,Thank you very much.,,
Savannah Guthrie,Thank you for listening to the voters’ questions.,,
Savannah Guthrie,That concludes our town hall.,,
Savannah Guthrie,"We do want to thank the president again, as well as our audience in hot Miami, and all of you watching at home.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"And a reminder, Donald Trump and Joe Biden are scheduled to meet in person a week from tonight in Nashville, a second and final presidential debate, moderated by our own Kristen Welker.",,
Savannah Guthrie,"Have a good evening, and thanks for being with us.",,
